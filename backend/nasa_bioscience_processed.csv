The disposition and metabolism of indeloxazine hydrochloride ((+/-)-2-[(inden-7-yloxy)methyl]morpholine hydrochloride) were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. 2. After oral administration of 14C-indeloxazine hydrochloride, the plasma concentration of total radioactivity reached a maximum at 15 min and declined with an apparent half-life of 2.2 h in the first 6 h period and declined more slowly thereafter. Unchanged drug in the plasma represented 13.5%, 5.9% and 0.4% of the total radioactivity at 15 min, 1 h and 6 h respectively after administration and levels decayed with a half-life of 0.9 h. 3. After oral and i.v. administration of the labelled compound, the urinary and faecal excretion of radioactivity in 72 h were 61-65% and 31-36% of the dose, respectively. Biliary excretion in bile duct-cannulated animals amounted to 49% of the dose in 72 h. 4. Seven metabolites have been isolated from the plasma or urine and characterized by i.r., n.m.r. and mass spectrometry. They were derived through dihydrodiol formation in the indene ring, hydroxylation of the indene ring and N-acetylation, oxidation and oxidative degradation of the morpholine ring. Some metabolites were excreted as their glucuronic acid or glucose conjugates. The major metabolite appeared to the trans-indandiol analogue of indeloxazine. 5. Possible metabolic pathways of degradation of the morpholine ring are discussed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,

The 1991 American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) contained 135 questions designated as basic science to assess residents' knowledge. We reviewed the separate progression of scores in clinical and basic sciences at Wayne State University (WSU) surgical residency and nationally through the 1991 ABSITE report. Regression analysis of WSU data yielded a slope (% correct answers per postgraduate year) of 5.3 for clinical and 2.4 for basic science scores (P < 0.001 by t-statistic applied to regression slopes). These data imply a progression of knowledge during residency but at a significantly slower rate for basic science. The national data confirm this trend, although we were unable to evaluate it statistically. This situation illustrates the need for organized teaching of clinically relevant basic science as part of a residency curriculum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998608/,

PMC8396460,State-dependent block underlies the tissue specificity of lidocaine action on batrachotoxin-activated cardiac sodium channels.,"G W Zamponi, D D Doyle, R J French",1993,Biophysical journal,"We have identified two kinetically distinct modes of block, by lidocaine, of cardiac sodium channels, activated by batrachotoxin and incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Here, we analyze the slow blocking mode which appears as a series of nonconducting events that increase in frequency and duration with increasing lidocaine concentrations. This type of block occurred rarely, if at all, for the skeletal muscle sodium channel subtype. Kinetic analysis showed that a linear open-closed-blocked model is sufficient to account for the major features of our data. Slow block occurs from a long closed state that is a distinguishing characteristic of cardiac channels under these conditions. Slow block showed no significant voltage dependence in the range of -60 to -20 mV for which the detailed kinetic analysis was performed, and was not elicited by application of the permanently charged lidocaine derivative QX-314. By contrast, the fast block, described in the companion paper, results from drug binding to the open state, and is similar for cardiac and skeletal muscle sodium channels. Application of trypsin to the cytoplasmic end of the channel eliminates both the spontaneous, long, gating closures and slow block. Thus, the lidocaine-sensitive closed state of batrachotoxin-activated cardiac sodium channels exhibits a protease susceptibility resembling that of the inactivated state of unmodified sodium channels. It is the slow block caused by lidocaine binding to this closed state that underlies the channel-subtype specificity of lidocaine action in our experiments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396460/,

These complexes are kinetically significant intermediates in the exchange of strands between the single-stranded DNA and an homologous linear duplex. After completion of strand exchange, the recA protein remains tightly associated with the circular duplex product of the reaction and the SSB is bound to the displaced linear single strand. Upon addition of ADP, the recA protein-duplex DNA complex dissociates. RecA protein also interacts with single-stranded DNA in the absence of SSB; however, the amount of recA protein bound is substantially reduced. These findings provide direct physical evidence for the participation of SSB in the formation of the recA protein-single-stranded DNA complexes inferred earlier from kinetic analysis. Moreover, they confirm the ability of recA protein to equilibrate between bound and free forms in the absence of SSB.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222041/,

Patients' characteristics were as follows: male: female ratio, 27:7; median age, 55 (34-76), median P.S., 1 (ECOG scale) (range 0-2). Patients studied had no renal, hepatic, or cardiac impairments, a life expectancy of greater than or equal to 3 months, and no previous treatment with RT or CT. Seventeen patients were previously untreated, and 17 had a relapse after radical surgery. The CT regimen consisted of 20 mg/m2 cisplatin, with 2 h forced diuresis, from day 1 to 5, and 200 mg/m2 i.v., from day 1 to 5, every 3 weeks, administered four times. The RT was performed after the first, second, and third CT course, and consisted of three courses of 20 Gy each, 2 Gy daily, 5 days per week. Weekend intervals were planned between CT and RT treatments. The 17 previously untreated patients showed an overall response rate of 88.2% [eight complete response (CR), seven partial response (PR), one stable disease (SD), one progression disease (PD)]; the 17 patients treated at relapse after radical surgery reached an overall response rate of 64.7% (six CR, five PR, six PD). Actuarial median survival is 47 weeks: 51 weeks in untreated patients, and 42 weeks in previously treated patients. Toxicity was mild, and only 10 patients suffered from grade III (WHO scale) gastrointestinal (2 patients), hematological (5 patients), mucosal (2 patients), and neurological (1 patient) toxicity.

The use of prophylactic pacing strategies to prevent post-operative AF has been controversial. We previously performed a pilot study which suggested that the combination of beta-blockers and bi-atrial pacing (BAP) may reduce AF after cardiac surgery. We prospectively randomized 118 patients to continuous BAP for up to 96 hours post-operatively versus standard therapy. All patients were treated with beta-blockers as tolerated. Patients were paced in the AAI mode at a rate of 100 pulses per minute. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of sustained AF (>10 minutes). There was a significant reduction in the incidence of AF in the BAP group among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with or without aortic valve replacement (35 % vs. 19 % AF; OR=0.38, 95 % CI 0.15, 0.93; p <0.05). Including patients undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery (n=7), there remained a strong trend toward a reduction of AF with pacing (no atrial pacing [NAP] vs. BAP; 35 % vs. 21 % AF; OR=0.48, 95 % CI 0.21, 1.11; p=0.08). Patients age 70 or greater benefited most from pacing (NAP vs. BAP; 55 vs. 25 % AF; p<0.05), while those less than 70 years of age did not (17 vs. 18 % p=NS). There was a significant reduction in the amount of time spent in the intensive care unit among patients receiving BAP (50+/-40 vs. 37+/-25 h; p<0.05).BAP together with beta-blockade after coronary artery bypass graft surgery reduces the incidence of post-operative atrial AF. Elderly patients (age 70 or greater) appear to benefit most, and may be a group to whom this therapy should be targeted.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11500582/,

Prompted by these observations, we undertook a search for cases of ""pure"" puerperal psychosis (ie, typical manifestations 3-14 days postpartum) in order to evaluate the clinical background of this phenomenon. Special attention was paid to the medications that the patients had received peripartum. In the last 10 years, out of eight perinatal centers, we found only three cases that fulfilled the criteria of the quoted entity. In all instances, the manifestations of puerperal psychosis had been preceded by the administration of ergot derivatives. Based on the presented data, we hypothesize that typical postpartum psychosis may represent an idiosyncratic reaction to potent vasoactive drugs including ergot derivatives. The similarities between the clinical manifestations of ergotism and puerperal psychosis, and some of the epidemiologic features of the latter condition, appear to implicate ergot alkaloids as potential causative agents. Although the validity of the suggested interpretation requires further evaluation, we believe that the currently available data warrant caution with regard to the administration of ergot derivatives postpartum. These drugs should not be used in the absence of clear indication or in unnecessarily high doses. We suggest that ergotism be included in the differential diagnosis in cases of pure puerperal psychosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915878/,

In isolated retinal vasculitis, antiretinal antibodies, non-retinal antibodies, and circulating immune complexes each showed a prevalence of about 50 per cent, but there was an inverse relationship between marked antiretinal autoimmunity and the occurrence of circulating immune complexes. In SID alone, antiretinal antibodies (ret-AB) were of lower prevalence (about 20 per cent) and occurred only in patients who had circulating immune complexes (CIC). Patients with RV + SID fell into two principal categories: (a) ret-AB with CIC, and (b) ret-AB without CIC. In isolated retinal vasculitis, the occurrence of high levels of retinal autoimmunity in the absence of circulating immune complexes was associated with the more severe retinal disease, while in those RV + SID patients who did not express autoimmunity, the more severe retinal disease was associated with the presence of circulating immune complexes. It is suggested that the formation of circulating autoimmune complexes, possibly of an idiotypic: anti-idiotypic character, may be a 'risk' mechanism for limiting retinal-specific autoimmunity, and that certain patients with severe retinal vasculitis may undercompensate or overcompensate in this way.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985101/,

The newly-developed method is named retrograde coronary sinus microperfusion technique. Canine hearts were arrested and cooled to 4 degrees C by means of normograde coronary perfusion with Collins' solution containing 10% fluorocarbon (FC) in order to avoid myocardial damage during warm ischemic time. Then, the hearts, immersed in Collins' solution, were retrogradely perfused through a coronary sinus at a rate of 60 ml/hr or 30 ml/hr with above-mentioned solution. After preservation for 36 hours, heterotopic heart transplantation was performed in an abdominal cavity of a recipient dog. The 36 hour-preserved hearts restored their cardiac beat after reperfusion with recipient blood. Histological observation did not show any abnormal findings in these preserved hearts. In order to evaluate the cardiac functions of preserved hearts for 24 to 36 hours, left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume ratio (Emax) and end-diastolic pressure-volume relation were measured. Both were well restored in 24 hour-preserved hearts. The 36 hour-preserved hearts resulted in Emax within a satisfactory range, while end-diastolic pressure was elevated in all cases. This was markedly impaired with infusion of isoproterenol. These results strongly suggested that transplantation using 24 hour-preserved hearts could be performed well. On the other hand, the 36 hour-preserved hearts were considered to function satisfactorily under careful management after grafting.

We describe a rapid new derivatization of amphetamine and methamphetamine using 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate for gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis. Amphetamine and methamphetamine, along with N-propyl amphetamine (internal standard), were extracted from urine using 1-chlorobutane. The derivatization with 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate can be achieved at room temperature in 10 minutes. The electron ionization mass spectrum of amphetamine 2,2,2-trichloroethyl carbamate showed two weak molecular ions at m/z 309 and 311, but showed diagnostic strong peaks at m/z 218, 220, and 222. In contrast, chemical ionization of the mass spectrum of amphetamine 2,2,2-trichloroethyl carbamate showed strong (M + 1) ions at m/z 310 and 312 and other strong diagnostic peaks at m/z 274 and 276. The major advantages of this derivative are the presence of a diagnostic cluster of peaks due to the isotopic effect of three chlorine atoms (isotopes 35 and 37) in the derivatized molecule and the relative ease of its preparation. We also observed strong molecular ions for derivatized methamphetamine in the chemical ionization mass spectrum, but the molecular ions were very weak in the electron ionization mass spectrum. We used the scan mode of mass spectrometry in all analyses. When using a urine standard containing 1,000 ng/mL of amphetamine (a 7.4-micromol/L concentration) and methamphetamine (a 6.7-micromol/L concentration), the within-run precisions were 4.8% for amphetamine and 3.6% for methamphetamine. The corresponding between-run precisions were 5.3% for amphetamine and 6.7% for methamphetamine. The assay was linear for amphetamine and methamphetamine concentrations of 250 to 5,000 ng/mL (amphetamine, 1.9-37.0 micromol/L; methamphetamine, 1.7-33.6 micromol/L). The detection limit was 100 ng/mL (amphetamine, 0.74 micromol/L; methamphetamine, 0.67 micromol/L) using the scan mode of electron ionization mass spectrometry.

Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter in pinealocytes. Moreover, we found that, in addition to glutamate and aspartate, cultured pinealocytes also released glycine upon stimulation by depolarizing concentrations of KCl, whereas the content of GABA in the culture medium did not exceed the detection limit either under control conditions or following KCl application. Therefore, we propose that glycine is a further component of the paracrine signaling system within the pineal organ which is based on the compartment of synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs) inside pinealocytes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166946/,

Factor analysis revealed three scales, each assessing the characteristic of one stage of readiness to change, the Precontemplation, Contemplation and Action scale. Firstly, the reliabilities of these scales were 0.61, 0.86 and 0.61, respectively, and only the latter two scales correlated significantly (r=0.14). Secondly, the scales were validated using subscales from the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, beliefs on the credibility of the self-management approach and subscales from the Illness Perception Questionnaire. These subscales explained 5, 22 and 8% of the variance of the scores on the Precontemplation, Contemplation and the Action scales, respectively. Thirdly, on the basis of the three scale scores, over 80% of the fibromialgia patients could be classified into one of five potentially psychological relevant subgroups: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action and Relapse. The data suggest that improvements in operationalizations of the Precontemplation and Action dimensions of readiness to change are needed and that the theoretical foundation of readiness to change needs further development.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166968/,

It may explain an increasing number of unexpected, sudden deaths in young adults that are or are not preceded by cardiac symptoms. A genetic transmission of the disease has been suggested by the study of familial cases. A location on chromosome 14 appears to be responsible for this disease. In some patients, a superimposed inflammatory process mixed with the pattern of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia may explain the progressive deterioration of left ventricular function. The systematic study of electrocardiograms demonstrates prolongation of the QRS complex and repolarization abnormalities in the right precordial leads due to a parietal block. Multiple therapeutic approaches are now available. The first line of therapy remains antiarrhythmic drugs, which are effective in most cases.

In those patients that survive the initial event, deaths due to re-bleeding have been reduced as a result of a trend to earlier surgical repair of the aneurysm. Unfortunately, a large percentage of patients go on to die or become permanently disabled from cerebral infarction as a consequence of vasospasm. The exact mechanisms that contribute to the development of cerebral vasospasm in these patients continue to elude researchers. The pathological processes implicated in the vasospasm phenomenon will be described. Even though no single pharmacological agent or treatment protocol has been identified that prevents or reverses this deadly complication, a number of promising intervention strategies are being employed in the critical care setting. These will be explored in light of the most current research findings. Clearly, early detection and prompt treatment are vital if the outcomes for persons suffering aneurysmal SAH are to improve. A sound knowledge base, well-developed assessment and clinical reasoning skills, and a deeper understanding of the pathological processes and treatment objectives will assist the neuroscience practitioner to more ably care for these most challenging patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716943/,

Ring-hydroxylated products and products arising from the further oxidation of the hydroxymethyl groups were formed when the hydroxymethyl derivatives were themselves incubated with rat-liver homogenates. 2. Pretreatment of the animal with 3-methylcholanthrene or with Sudan III, which can protect rat adrenal glands from damage by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene or by its 7-hydroxymethyl derivative, led to an increased rate of metabolism of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and its hydroxymethyl derivatives. The metabolic routes mainly affected were those involving the formation of ring-hydroxylated products. 3. Pretreatment with phenobarbitone led to a small increase in the rate of metabolism of the hydrocarbon and of its hydroxymethyl derivatives, but the increase appeared mainly to involve increased metabolism of the methyl and hydroxymethyl groups. 4. Pretreatment with metyrapone increased the rate of metabolism of the hydrocarbon mainly by increasing the amounts of products resulting from hydroxylation of the methyl groups: small increases in the amounts of ring-hydroxylated products were also produced. 8.

ICa, blocked by nifedipine, reappeared in qualitatively different phases (immediate and delayed) following photoinactivation of nifedipine. Immediate recovery was attributed to unblock of closed Ca2+ channels, while delayed recovery was attributed to unblock of inactivated channels. In contrast to the ICa results, photoinactivation of nifedipine produced only delayed recovery of Ig. Analysis of these results suggests the following conclusions. First, the actions of inhibitory dihydropyridines can be attributed to binding to either the inactivated or the closed conformation, but only binding to the inactivated state is associated with reduction of Ig. Second, the action of inhibitory dihydropyridines on closed channels is to retard their movement through a final, voltage-independent transition to the open state. This effect seems to be the converse of a major action of stimulatory dihydropyridines and thus is the principal mechanistic difference between stimulatory and inhibitory dihydropyridines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503278/,

The trachea, which prevents exposure of the cervical esophagus, is dissected while maintaining the continuity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The tracheal stumps were turned over like a double door, and the esophageal tumor is excised with sufficient margins for suturing. The cervical esophagus is safely replaced with a free jejunum or the stomach followed by tracheal reconnection. The technique of tracheal reconnection in the neck is not difficult and is a safe procedure. Anastomotic insufficiency of the trachea may be compensated for with a temporary tracheostomy. This method is applicable in esophagectomy not only with curative but also with palliative intent to offer the patient a better quality of life. Theoretically, this method can be applied even for tumors minimally invading the trachea in which the invaded tracheal segment can be excised in combination with the esophagus, followed by tracheal anastomosis.

Sixty women were randomized into two groups, A (continuous) and B (intermittent). Twenty-eight patients in Group A and 29 in Group B completed the study. We compared the groups with regard to satisfaction with pain relief for both labour and delivery as measured by a Visual Analogue Scale on five occasions during and after parturition. There was no difference between groups at any of the five stages. The difference in pain scores before the epidural and after the epidural was significant for both groups (p less than 0.001). The incidence of missed segments, degrees of motor block, height of sensory block, length of labour and fetal outcome were similar in both groups. Plasma bupivacaine levels were measured in six patients in each group. Mothers in Group A received more drug than those in Group B (p less than 0.01) but plasma bupivacaine levels remained low in the mother and the umbilical cord samples in the sub-set from this group. More women in Group A required outlet forceps (p less than 0.05) whereas mid-forceps and Caesarean section rates were similar in the two groups.

Chronic depression of the adrenergic innervation to the saphenous artery induces an adaptive and nonspecific increase in sensitivity which appears with a delay of 3 days. Coincident with the supersensitivity, the smooth muscle cells undergo a partial depolarization which brings the resting potential closer to the threshold potential for contraction.

Phospholamban is a key regulator of cardiac contractility and modulates SR Ca2+ sequestration by inhibiting the SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) in its dephosphorylated state. Upon phosphorylation, which is mediated through beta-adrenergic stimulation, the inhibitory effect of phospholamban on the function of SERCA is relieved. This review summarizes recent advances that have been made towards understanding the modulation of SR Ca2+-sequestration by phospholamban through the generation and characterization of genetically altered animal models. It also discusses the role of phospholamban in human heart failure and recent attempts to restore SR function in experimentally induced and human heart failure, which may be translated into future therapeutic approaches in the treatment of this disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11127935/,

Both methods gave indistinguishable values for U. Total non-urea nitrogen excretion (NUN) and its components did not correlate with dietary nitrogen. NUN averaged 31.3 +/- 2.1 mg N/kg/day and was not different between the two groups or in patients in neutral compared to those in mildly negative or positive nitrogen balance. Nitrogen balance calculated using estimated U and 31 mg N/kg/day was indistinguishable statistically from measured nitrogen balance. Thus, U varies directly with dietary protein intake and can be estimated using urinary urea nitrogen, SUN, and body weight. Total nitrogen excretion can be estimated accurately as U + 31 mg N/kg/day. From the estimated total nitrogen excretion, dietary compliance of CRF patients in approximately neutral nitrogen balance could be assessed.

The homopolymer showed a similar thermal and total hypochromicity to poly(G) at the long wavelength absorption maximum. No sigmoid melting profile was observed for poly(c7G) as is found for poly(G), implying a single-stranded structure in aqueous solution. From the circular dichroism spectra it can be concluded that the 7-deazapurine nucleotide is much more flexible than the purine nucleotide. In analogy to poly(G), the homopolymer poly(c7G) forms a 1:1 complex with poly(C) under neutral conditions, melting at a similar temperature to the poly(G) complex. However, at pH 2.5, where a poly(G) X 2poly(C) complex is observed, poly(c7G) still binds only one poly(C) strand. This is due to the lack of N-7 in poly(c7G), not allowing Hoogsteen base pair formation, which occurs with poly(G). RNase T1 cleaves poly(c7G), indicating that N-7 of guanosine is not a requirement for nucleotide binding to the enzyme, as has been suggested. Because of the single-stranded structure of poly(c7G), the polynucleotide chain is rapidly hydrolyzed by the single-strand-specific nuclease S1, whereas multistranded poly(G) is completely resistant.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289879/,

Nine women performed a 30-min treadmill run in which the exercise intensity was made more difficult every 10 min (35%, 60%, and 75%). Carbohydrate (CHO) utilization and oxidation rates for the 35% and 60% intensities during the ML session were significantly lower than during the comparable intensities in the MF. Conversely, lipid utilization and oxidation were significantly greater during the 35% and 60% ML session than in the MF session. At 75%, however, the ML and MF CHO-lipid utilization and oxidation rates were not significantly different from one another. Thus, the phase of the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic women does influence metabolic substrate usage during low- to moderate-intensity submaximal exercise, probably due to changes in the endogenous levels of the female sex hormones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987364/,

Protein expression was investigated in normal, nonirradiated adult fibroblasts and also in fibroblastic cells from a benign cutaneous tumour after chronic ultraviolet (UVB) exposure and a metastatic cutaneous tumour after intermittent exposure. Proteins were separated and visualised by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and a peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) was obtained for protein spots using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS). Cross-species PMF database analysis facilitated the identification of 120 proteins, constituting 46.5% of the proteins analysed. The identification of two proteins was confirmed by internal amino acid sequencing using tandem MS. Differential protein expression was observed between normal fibroblasts and those in tumours chronically or intermittently exposed. A number of tropomyosin and vimentin isoforms were expressed only in cells from the metastatic tumour induced by intermittent exposure to UV radiation. These results highlight the value of cross-species PMF analysis for the rapid characterisation of proteins from a poorly defined species and also show how proteomics can be used to detect changes in protein expression in differentially treated cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,

According to data from the 1997 National Institute on Drug Abuse monograph Monitoring The Future, heroin use by American high school 12th graders was 100% higher than it was from 1990 to 1996 (0.90-1.8%). In 1997, there was a further increase to 2.1%. Additional support for an increase in heroin use in the United States comes from analysis of recent survey data from California, Texas, and Maryland. Heroin imported from Colombia and from Mexico is now cheaper and of high potency, permitting novices to start with nasal administration of the drug. Most American adolescents now initiate heroin use by snorting it; however, frequent use of heroin by any route rapidly leads to tolerance and intense drug craving. Psychological dependence to heroin, and to the often exciting yet chaotic lifestyle of a heroin addict, is very difficult to overcome. Acute heroin withdrawal syndrome is usually not severe and most addicts in withdrawal can be managed in an outpatient setting. Naloxone must be used with great restraint and in smaller than usual doses in known heroin addicts. Successful long-term management often includes acute detoxification followed by long-term residential drug treatment. Managed care payment issues have impeded placement in appropriate treatment programs. Additional long-term management issues include regular attendance at 12-step meetings (Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous), biweekly urine tests for drugs of abuse, attention to issues of dual diagnosis (group or family therapy), and reapproachment with family, school, and straight friends.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9832585/,

The present sequential high-performance liquid chromatography--high-performance liquid chromatography method overcomes problems in trace-level sample enrichment and recovery corrections encountered earlier. An amount of 5 g of naphtha or fuel oil is diluted to 10 ml with dichloromethane and spiked with a small quantity (ca. 0.25 micrograms) of 14C-labeled BaP tracer. A BaP-enriched fraction is obtained from a 1-ml aliquot of this sample by semipreparative chromatography on a Partisil PAC 10 column with dichloromethane-hexane (10:90) as the eluent, and concentrated to exactly 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0 ml in acetonitrile. Quantitation is performed using a reversed-phase Vydac 201 TP 5415 column with acetonitrile-water (75:25) as eluent and a Waters Model 420 E/420 AC fluorescence detector, employing an excitation/emission filter pair of 360/425 nm. The recovery of the radiolabeled tracer is evaluated by combustion of 50 microliter of the final isolate in pure oxygen, collection of the liberated 14CO2 in an alkaline desorber, and liquid scintillation counting. The recovery of BaP normally exceeded 90%, but values as low as ca. 50% were occasionally observed. Potential matrix interferences in the recovery determination were eliminated by sample combustion.

With dynamic cooling, the epidermis can be cooled selectively. When a cryogen spurt is applied to the skin surface for an appropriately short period of time (on the order of tens of milliseconds), the cooling remains localized in the epidermis, while leaving the temperature of the deeper PWS vessels unchanged. Comparative measurements obtained by a fast infrared imaging detector demonstrated that the surface temperature prior to laser exposure could be reduced by as much as 40 degrees C using the dynamic cooling technique. No skin surface textural changes were noted on PWS test sites cooled with a 20- to 80-millisecond cryogen spurt after flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (FLPPDL) exposure (lambda = 585 nm; tau p = 450 microseconds) at the maximum light dosage possible (10 J/cm2). In contrast, epidermal necrosis occurred on the uncooled sites after such exposure. Six months after laser exposure, clinically significant blanching on the cooled sites indicates laser photothermolysis of PWS blood vessels did occur. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate the feasibility of selectively cooling the normal overlying epidermis without affecting the temperature of the deeper PWS vessels. Furthermore, protection of the epidermis from thermal injury, produced by melanin light absorption at clinically relevant wavelengths, can be achieved effectively. An additional advantage of dynamic epidermal cooling is reduction of patient discomfort associated with FLPPDL therapy. Further studies are under way to determine an optimum strategy for applying this dynamic cooling technique during pulsed laser treatment of patients with PWS and others with selected dermatoses (dermal melanocytic lesions and tattoos).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7778922/,

CBP is a protein that is associated with and coactivates the transcription factor CREB, mediating the induction by cyclic AMP of certain responsive promoters. The sequences of p300 and CBP are highly related. We show here that p300, like CBP2, can stimulate transcription. This activity is directly and specifically inhibited by E1A. We also find that CBP exists in a DNA-bound complex containing a member of the CREB family and that E1A and CBP interact with one another in vivo. In keeping with the idea that E1A functionally targets CBP, cAMP-dependent transcription is repressed by E1A.

By using enzymic assay techniques, palmitoyl-CoA or CoA was found to inhibit glucose-6-phosphatase activity in intact microsomes. The effect of CoA required ATP and fatty acids to form fatty acyl esters. Increasing concentrations (2-50 microM) of CoA (plus ATP and 20 microM added palmitic acid) or of palmitoyl-CoA progressively decreased glucose-6-phosphatase activity to 50% of the control value. The inhibition lowered the Vmax without significantly changing the Km. A non-hydrolysable analogue of palmitoyl-CoA also inhibited, demonstrating that binding of palmitoyl-CoA rather than hydrolysis produces the inhibition. Light-scattering measurements of osmotically induced changes in the size of rat liver microsomal vesicles pre-equilibrated in a low-osmolality buffer demonstrated that palmitoyl-CoA alone or CoA plus ATP and palmitic acid altered the microsomal permeability to glucose 6-phosphate, but not to glucose or phosphate, indicating that T1 is the site of palmitoyl-CoA binding and inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase activity in native microsomes. The type of inhibition found suggests that liver microsomes may comprise vesicles heterogeneous with respect to glucose-6-phosphate translocase(s), i.e. sensitive or insensitive to fatty acid ester inhibition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733874/,

Endothelial dysfunction and loss of arterial elasticity are early markers of hypertension and atherosclerosis. We studied the prevalence of these markers in 44 healthy, prepubertal (age 9+/-1.3 years) children, 22 with LBW for age. Endothelial function in skin was tested with the local application of acetylcholine (inducing endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and nitroglycerin (endothelium-independent vasodilation), and local perfusion changes were measured with the laser Doppler method. The elastic properties of the abdominal aorta and common carotid artery were measured with an ultrasonic vessel-wall tracking system. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was lower in children with LBW (88+/-33 perfusion units [PU]) than in normal-birthweight controls (133+/-34 PU, P<0.001). There was no difference in aortic or carotid elasticity between the 2 groups, but a negative correlation was found between birthweight and stiffness of the carotid artery wall (r=-0.45, P<0.01).

We assigned individuals to three groups. All patients received lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily for 10 days, followed by 30 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Patients infected with H pylori received either antibiotics (clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily) or placebo for the first 10 days. Controls were patients not infected with H pylori. Patients were followed up for 6 months at 2-week intervals for GORD symptoms.

At the end of the study 16 of these patients were H pylori-positive (14 placebo and two eradication failures), 13 were negative because of successful H pylori eradication, and 29 were controls. H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier (54 days) than did those in whom H pylori was eradicated (100 days) (p=0.046).

When results were corrected for the affect of oesophagitis grade, H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier (p=0.086) than H pylori-eradiated patients and controls (p=0.001). H pylori infection positively affects the relapse rate of GORD. Eradication of H pylori could, therefore, help to prolong disease-free interval in patients with GORD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11403809/,
PMC8513672,Menstrual blood loss with use of a vaginal ring releasing 20 micrograms levonorgestrel per day. World Health Organization. Task force on long-acting systemic agents for fertility regulation.,,1993,Contraception,"Menstrual blood loss (MBL), haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels were studied in a total of 127 women from three developing country centres, using a vaginal ring releasing 20 micrograms levonorgestrel/day. The objective was to evaluate changes in MBL and body iron stores over one year of use. The discontinuation rate for bleeding problems varied between centres from 3 to 13% at one year, but these differences were not significant. There were no differences in MBL or iron status on admission between women who completed or discontinued from the study. Even though there was considerable variation in MBL and haemoglobin levels among the three centres before insertion of the ring, a decrease in MBL was observed in all centres after commencement of ring use. Conversely, an increase in haemoglobin levels was noted in all centres although the change reached significance only in Beijing. There were no alterations in serum ferritin levels. These results suggest that use of a vaginal ring releasing 20 micrograms levonorgestrel/day for one year will not significantly affect menstrual blood loss volume nor cause changes in body iron stores.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513672/,

A controversy exists, however, on the dimensional structure of the ECBI. To evaluate this issue, an exploratory factor analysis was first performed on a sample of 1,263 children and adolescents. This analysis identified 3 meaningful factors (i.e., Oppositional Defiant Behavior Toward Adults, Inattentive Behavior and Conduct Problem Behavior) and a fourth, poorly defined factor. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) evaluated the fit of the 3 meaningful factors in a second sample of 1,264 children and adolescents. The 3-factor model with 2 correlated errors provided a excellent fit. This 3-factor model also provided a significantly better fit than 2- and 1-factor models. Multiple group CFA indicated that the factor pattern, item-factor loadings, factor correlations, and correlated errors were equivalent across the samples. The CFA on sex yielded similar results. Initial normative information is presented for boys (n = 1,322) and girls (n = 1,205) within 4 age ranges (i.e., 2-5, 6-9, 10-13, 14-17) for the 3 factors.

The splenocytes were from patients undergoing splenectomy during staging for Hodgkin disease after vaccination with the J5 mutant of Escherichia coli, which is deficient in O antigenic side chains. This deficiency exposes the core oligosaccharide, common to LPS of all Gram-negative bacteria. The mAbs cross-reacted strongly with endotoxins from a wide range of unrelated species of Gram-negative bacteria. The mAbs also gave strong protection against LPS in the dermal Shwartzman reaction and against lethal Gram-negative bacteremia in mice. These findings indicate that monoclonal IgM against LPS endotoxin can neutralize its toxicity in vivo and might be valuable for treatment of patients with Gram-negative bacteremia. Analysis of one of the hybridoma clones, A6(H4C5), showed that the IgM mAb is directed against the covalently bound lipid A, which represents the most conservative and least variable structural element of LPS.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856860/,

Variant No. 1 differed from the active variant by the growth dynamics and colony morphology. Variant No. 2 was close to the active variant by the growth dynamics. It was shown with electron microscopy that the cells of variant No. 1 differed from those of the active variant in the number and form of the mycelial septa, more even and compact structure of the cell walls and higher sensitivity to actinomycin. Still, they were more stable to the effect of lysozyme and ultrasound.

We previously reported that cimetidine reduced postbypass depression of the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells. This study evaluated cimetidine as an agent to preserve cellular immunity after cardiac operations. In a prospective randomized study, 20 patients were divided into two groups of equal size. Cimetidine-group patients received 400 mg of cimetidine intravenously before bypass and a 33 mg/hr intravenous infusion of cimetidine after the operation, continuing until the fifth postoperative day. Control-group patients received conventional perioperative therapy. Lymphocyte subsets, natural killer cell activity, percentage of CD56+CD16+ (percentage of natural killer cells), and percentage of CD11b+CD8+ (percentage of suppressor T lymphocytes) were measured perioperatively. Although temporary postoperative reductions in percentages of CD3+, CD4+, and CD56+CD16+ cells were observed in both groups, CD8+ percentages on postoperative day 1 and CD11b+CD8+ percentages on postoperative days 1 and 3 in the cimetidine group were significantly lower compared with those in the control group (p = 0.01,p = 0.004, andp = 0.02, respectively). Temporary postoperative reduction of natural killer cell activity was also observed in both groups, but the natural killer cell activity on postoperative day 1 in the cimetidine group (17.1%) was significantly higher (p = 0.02) than that in the control group (8.20%).

The virally activated ornithine decarboxylase removes ornithine from participation in the urea cycle by metabolizing ornithine to putrescine which, in turn, is metabolized to spermidine. Once ornithine has been removed from participation in the urea cycle, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate levels increase until the carbamoyl phosphate passes from the mitochondria into the cytosol where it is metabolized by the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. Through the implementation of this process, the virus has insured that: host cell RNA polymerase in liver cells is inactivated, viral RNA polymerase has complete access to newly synthesized pyrimidines, production of pyrimidines for the synthesis of viral messenger RNA is initiated, spermidine, a mRNA stabilizer is produced, many of the components necessary for viral mRNA synthesis are provided by the host cell's RNA synthesizing mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379395/,

Here, we examined whether TNF-alpha modulates the production of leptin, the recently identified fat-specific energy balance hormone, in cultured adipocytes and in mice. TNF-alpha treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in rapid stimulation of leptin accumulation in the media, with a maximum effect at 6 h. This stimulation was insensitive to cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, but was completely inhibited by the secretion inhibitor brefeldin A, indicating a posttranslational effect. Treatment of mice with TNF-alpha also caused a similar increase in plasma leptin levels. Finally, in obese TNF-alpha-deficient mice, circulating leptin levels were significantly lower, whereas adipose tissue leptin was higher compared with obese wild-type animals. These data provide evidence that TNF-alpha can act directly on adipocytes to regulate the release of a preformed pool of leptin. Furthermore, they suggest that the elevated adipose tissue expression of TNF-alpha that occurs in obesity may contribute to obesity-related hyperleptinemia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9389742/,

Supplement,"Until about two years ago, the only known function of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was inhibition of tumor growth. Since then it has become apparent that many types of normal and transformed cells express specific high-affinity TNF receptors (Kd 200 pM) and that the presence of receptors does not correlate with susceptibility to the cytotoxic/cytostatic action of TNF. Recent evidence shows that TNF exerts a variety of other important biological activities on cells in culture and in the intact organism. Among the newly recognized activities is a potent mitogenic effect in fibroblasts. Many of the activities of TNF overlap the actions of interleukin-1 (IL-1).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824534/,

The patients belonged to four families of Iraqi Jewish origin. Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested by parental consanguinity in three families and recurrence in another sib in one family. The patients were all born after uneventful pregnancy and labor, with birth weight in the normal range. There were no dysmorphic features. Three patients were breast fed. Diarrhea started between the first and eighth day of life. Diarrhea was of the secretory type. No pathogen was cultured from the stool. Jejunal biopsies performed on all patients ranged from normal to severe partial villous atrophy. The patients received different drug regimens with no beneficial effect and all are dependent on TPN.

We have identified a distinct open reading frame at the left end of RRV and designated it R1. The position of the R1 gene is equivalent to that of the saimiri transforming protein (STP) of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) and of K1 of KSHV, other members of the gamma-2 or rhadinovirus subgroup of herpesviruses. The R1 sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a product of 423 amino acids that was predicted to contain an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail reflective of a type I membrane-bound protein. The predicted structural motifs of R1, including the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, resembled those in K1 of KSHV but were distinct from those of STP. R1 sequences from four independent isolates from three different macaque species revealed 0.95 to 7.3% divergence over the 423 amino acids. Variation was located predominantly within the predicted extracellular domain. The R1 protein migrated at 70 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was extensively glycosylated. Tagged R1 protein was localized to the cytoplasmic and plasma membranes of transfected cells. Expression of the R1 gene in Rat-1 fibroblasts induced morphologic changes and focus formation, and injection of R1-expressing cells into nude mice induced the formation of multifocal tumors. A recombinant herpesvirus in which the STP oncogene of HVS was replaced by R1 immortalized T lymphocytes to interleukin-2-independent growth.

Experiments on ten allergic asthmatic patients and ten healthy subjects as control were performed. Cytokine production, triggered in PBMCs culture systems by PHA, was modulated with Indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and IL-10 was measured in 24 hours culture supernatants. According to our experimental data, IL-10 level of asthmatic patients' PBMCs in the resting state is not significantly different from control. PHA-activated PBMCs from asthmatic patients do not display significantly higher IL-10 levels than the normal subjects. The results obtained up-to-date reveal the fact that Indomethacin strongly down-regulates IL-10 levels in PBMCs cultures, in both asthmatic allergic patients and healthy subjects. It is obvious that the inhibitory effect of Indomethacin on IL-10 released by PBMCs is higher in the case of allergic asthmatic patients.

Additional 10 male and 10 female animals were treated for 14 months and then sacrificed for interim examination. Groups of 60 male and 60 female Syrian golden hamsters received D-glucose in the form of 20% solution in tap water for a period of 80 weeks. In each case, groups consisting of an equal number of untreated animals served as controls. General behavior and mortality were not affected by the treatment. The rats and hamsters treated with glucose showed significantly higher body weights of up to a maximum of 16% in male and 26% in female rats, or 15% in male and female hamsters. In rats, the increase was evident by week 14, and in the hamsters by week 10. Glucose-dosed rats displayed a slightly increased feed intake and a reduced water intake. Both parameters, however, were not influenced in hamsters. Hematological and histopathological examination showed no pertinent changes in hematopoetic tissue. Sharply increased blood glucose and renal glucose excretion values were present in rats beginning with 18 months and were indicative of the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The insulin concentrations in peripheral blood were not appreciably affected, although there was a trend to higher values in males at all evaluation times and in females only at 3 months. Pathological evaluation did not show any compound related non-neoplastic lesions. The incidences of islet cell adenomas in the pancreas of male rats were significantly increased and the cortical adenomas in the adrenals of females were decreased. In addition, the mammary gland adenomas (in females) and the Leydig cell tumors of the testes were decreased. In hamsters, the incidence of adrenocortical adenomas were increased in the females. No other pertinent neoplastic changes were observed. In conclusion, the increases and decreases in benign neoplasms of hormone-sensitive tissues, appear to be the result of nutritionally/metabolism-induced modulation of the homeostasis in these 4 tissues in both species, and not the result of chronic glucose administration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9706465/,

Whole-cell extracts were prepared for gel mobility shift assay using oligonucleotides containing the heat shock element. Induction of mRNA for HSP70 and HSP90 was examined by Northern blot analysis.

The first neural inducers studied were proteins produced by dorsal mesoderm (the Spemann organizer); most of these proteins act by directly binding to and antagonizing the function of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Recent experiments have suggested that other secreted signals, such as Wnt and FGF, may neuralize ectoderm before organizer function by a different mechanism. Neural effector genes that mediate the response of ectoderm to secreted neuralizing signals have also been discovered. Interestingly, most of these newly identified neuralizing pathways continue the theme of BMP antagonism, but rather than antagonizing BMP protein function, they may neuralize tissue by suppressing Bmp expression. Down-regulation of Bmp expression in the prospective neural plate during gastrulation seems to be a shared feature of neural induction in vertebrate embryos. However, the signals used to accomplish this task seem to vary among vertebrates. Here, we will discuss the role of the recently identified secreted signals and neural effector genes in vertebrate neurogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11747068/,

The SODs were characterized by PAGE and by their sensitivity to azide, cyanide and hydrogen peroxide. SOD activity was detected in cell extracts as well as in extracellular medium of all AIDS-MAC strains. PAGE demonstrated a single activity band for each strain, though there were differences in mobility. All LR strains demonstrated an activity band with Rf = 0.30, while SOD band for MAC 101 and for SK strains migrated further (Rf = 0.87). The differences in mobility correlated with differences in sensitivity to NaN3 and H2O2. The SOD activity of LR strains was irreversibly inhibited 100% by 5 mM H2O2, and exhibited greater sensitivity to NaN3, suggesting the presence of iron in the enzyme. The SOD activity of SK strains and MAC 101, however, was not inhibited by 5 mM H2O2 but was inhibited to a lesser extent by NaN3, which is characteristic of a manganese-containing SOD. Our data indicate that MAC strains are rich in manganese- or iron-containing SOD, which could contribute to the organism's resistance to the oxidative burst of activated macrophages.

This action is attributed to the transcriptional activity of the ER, a ligand-dependent transcription factor. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying estrogen-induced proliferation has yet to be completely elucidated. Using custom cDNA microarrays containing many genes implicated in cell cycle progression and DNA replication, we examined the gene expression of a hormone-responsive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) treated with a mitogenic dose of estrogen in the absence of confounding growth factors found in serum. Gene expression changes were monitored 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after estrogen stimulation so that RNA levels at critical times throughout cell cycle progression could be monitored. Significant changes include the altered transcript levels of genes implicated in transcription, cellular signaling, and cell cycle checkpoints. At time points during which increased numbers of cells were progressing through S phase, a majority of the genes associated with the DNA replication fork were also found to be induced. The coexpression of DNA replication fork genes by estrogen without the support of serum growth factors indicates an important estrogen regulatory component of the molecular mechanism driving estrogen-induced mitogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12040010/,

Plasma glucose, insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total testosterone (TT) were determined. Free androgen index (FAI) and fasting insulin to glucose ratio (IGR) were calculated. The cut off point to define hyperinsulinemia was established at 23 microIU/mg. Mean age was 54.8 years. Mean age at menopause was 47.7 years. Body mass index (BMI) was greater than 25 in 46 patients, and 28 (26.9%) were hyperinsulinemic. BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, and 2-hour postglucose insulin levels were significantly higher in hyperinsulinemic patients. Hyperinsulinemic patients had higher TT levels (P =.02), FAI (P =.0001), and lower SHBG levels (P =.003). Positive correlations were observed between IGR and BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference, and triglycerides. IGR and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were negatively correlated. IGR presented a positive association with TT and FAI and a negative association with SHBG. FAI contributed positively to IGR, independently of BMI, age, or time since menopause. In conclusion, androgen levels may be important determinants of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in peri- and postmenopausal women.

The clinical course varies. Treatment is controversial and few data on drug sensitivity are available. We evaluated the clinical course and treatment of 10 MCC patients and determined MCC chemosensitivity. Clinical records as well as laboratory and histopathologic data from 10 patients with MCC treated in our department were examined. Chemosensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents and interferons of MCC cells from four patients was determined in a soft agar clonogenic assay. MCC behaved as an aggressive tumor with early and frequent local relapses (4 of 10 patients at a 2.2-month average), regional (4 of 10 patients at 2.5 months), and distant metastases (5 of 10 patients 9.6 months after excision of the primary tumor). In all but one patient, regional metastases preceded distant ones. Metastatic spread was associated with an average survival of 21 months from the initial diagnosis. Long-term survival (53+ and 65+ months) was observed in two women. Wide excision of the primary tumor, alone or combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, was the most effective treatment. In advanced disease, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were not able to induce long-term remission. In vitro assays for MCC drug sensitivity revealed cisplatin, doxorubicin, and vindesine to be the most active. MCC has a poor prognosis in advanced stages; therefore the primary tumor should be aggressively treated. The in vitro clonogenic assay may help to identify the chemosensitivity profile of MCC and to optimize chemotherapy protocols.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9146534/,

The vaccines for mucosal delivery were sprayed into one nostril and contained D and T toxoids in an enhancer mixture of polysorbate and caprylic/capric glycerides. All of the vaccines gave rise mainly to a systemic IgG response. Among 51 persons with anti-D antibody concentrations in serum below a protective level of 0.01 international units (IU ml-1) before vaccination, all except two attained protective antibody concentrations 4 weeks after vaccination. The median increase in anti-D antibody concentration was 113-fold with the most efficient i.n. formulation. The median increase in anti-T antibody level was 2.4-fold, however, the pre-vaccination levels for this antigen were very high. Within the examined levels, the booster response depended mainly on the dose of the antigen in the vaccine rather than on the concentration of the vehicle mixture.

Because we allow for mixtures of materials and treat voxels as regions, our technique reduces errors that other classification techniques can create along boundaries between materials and is particularly useful for creating accurate geometric models and renderings from volume data. It also has the potential to make volume measurements more accurately and classifies noisy, low-resolution data well. There are two unusual aspects to our approach. First, we assume that, due to partial-volume effects, or blurring, voxels can contain more than one material, e.g., both muscle and fat; we compute the relative proportion of each material in the voxels. Second, we incorporate information from neighboring voxels into the classification process by reconstructing a continuous function, rho(x), from the samples and then looking at the distribution of values that rho(x) takes on within the region of a voxel. This distribution of values is represented by a histogram taken over the region of the voxel; the mixture of materials that those values measure is identified within the voxel using a probabilistic Bayesian approach that matches the histogram by finding the mixture of materials within each voxel most likely to have created the histogram. The size of regions that we classify is chosen to match the spacing of the samples because the spacing is intrinsically related to the minimum feature size that the reconstructed continuous function can represent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9617909/,

During 2 h of observation of ictal activity, 3 alpha-Diol (3.0 and 7.5 mg/kg) prior to kainic acid significantly decreased the number and duration of partial and full seizures compared to the 0.0 3 alpha-Diol conditions and produced ictal activity that was comparable to 0.0 mg/kg 3 alpha-Diol no kainic acid controls (procedure controls). Animals that received 7.5 mg/kg 3 alpha-Diol prior to kainic acid had shorter latencies and distances to the hidden platform in a Morris Water Maze task than those that received 0.0 3 alpha-Diol, 1 week following ictal activity. Administration of 3 alpha-Diol (3.0 or 7.5 mg/kg) prior to kainic acid stimulation resulted in a greater number of identifiable neurons in the hilar region of the hippocampus, compared to 0.0 3 alpha-Diol condition. Experiment 2 was conducted to ascertain whether 3 alpha-Diol's anti-seizure effects were comparable to T and possibly a result of metabolism from T. Ovx rats (n = 36) were stereotaxically implanted with bipolar electrodes into the perforant pathway. One hour prior to perforant pathway stimulation, six rats were s.c. injected with either T (7.5 mg/kg), 3 alpha-Diol (7.5 mg/kg), 7.5 mg/kg T + 4MA (a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, 17 beta-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4aza,5 alpha-androstan-3-one), 4MA alone, 10% propylene glycol vehicle (veh) with perforant pathway stimulation, or veh without perforant pathway stimulation. 3 alpha-Diol and T produced similar seizure activity, water maze performance, and neuronal integrity in the hilar region of the hippocampus that were comparable to unstimulated controls. Because the T and 3 alpha-Diol groups were not different from T + 4MA but tended to be different from 4MA alone on these measures, this suggests that 3 alpha-Diol and T can have similar anti-seizure effects which may be due to actions of neurosteroids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9695138/,

She had recurrence of incomplete paralysis of right extremities with speech disturbance and admitted to our department on April 7. Neurological examination revealed right hemiparesis. Plain skull rentogenorgram showed a calcification extending posteriorly from the left anterior clinoid process. CT scan showed a mass lesion located at the left frontal lobe to the ambient cistern. The mass lesion showed high density, but its midportion was isodensity. The left carotid angiogram demonstrated abnormally curved, tortuous and dilated internal carotid artery at the intracavernous portion (C3) to bifurcation (C1). The cerebral circulation time was greatly delayed, which regained about 6 seconds for the visualization of the distal portion of the middle cerebral artery. On the basis of the above, we considered that the first right hemiparesis was due to emboli produced in the dolichoectasia and the following progressive stroke was attributable to the low perfusion demonstrated by a great delay of circulation time. The operation was performed to trap the dolichoectasia after STA-MCA anastomosis. However, trapping procedure was very difficult because of hardness of the distal portion of the involved artery. Therefore, surgery was concluded with STA-MCA anastomosis and only proximal internal carotid clipping.

The water droplet sizes and location of the probes have been determined from the decay kinetics of hydrated electrons. The yields and half-lives (t 1/2 ) of the hydrated electrons vary smoothly as the water droplet sizes are changed.

A cDNA clone containing the melanin biosynthetic gene encoding scytalone dehydratase (SCD1) from C. lagenarium was identified by hybridization with a heterologous cDNA probe from Magnaporthe grisea. The cDNA clone was used to identify a cosmid containing SCD1 in a genomic library of C. lagenarium, and the nucleotide sequence was determined for both the cDNA and genomic clones. The SCD1 gene contained one open reading frame composed of 188 codons and two deduced introns of 57 and 67 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of SCD1 showed high similarity to the amino acid sequence of scytalone dehydratase from Cochliobolus miyabeanus. A plasmid containing the SCD1 gene transformed the melanin-deficient mutant 9201Y (Scd-) to the wild phenotype but did not complement the conditional scytalone dehydratase-deficient mutant C. lagenarium 8015.

Uptake was measured using tritium labelled serotonin and basal concentrations estimated spectrophotofluorometrically. Serotonin uptake was significantly increased both in the patients with chronic stable angina of effort and in those with a history of myocardial infarction six months or more previously. Sulphinpyrazone reduced serotonin uptake from 94.25 (SE 8.65) to 57.86 (5.37) cpm/10(8) platelets after 24 weeks of treatment in the group with stable angina and from 137.45 (16.26) to 68.08 (8.38) cpm/10(8) platelets in the myocardial infarction group. Raised basal concentrations in the two groups were also reduced by sulphinpyrazone. Placebo had no effect on serotonin uptake or basal concentrations in either group of patients. The ability of sulphinpyrazone to inhibit uptake and reduce basal concentrations of serotonin in patients with ischaemic heart disease may be yet another mechanism through which this drug exerts its beneficial antiplatelet effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092937/,

Probenecid and furosemide are drugs which have been reported to protect against cisplatin nephrotoxicity, by unknown mechanisms. When probenecid 0.3 mM is included in the perfusate net transport of platinum is increased to 200% of that accounted for by glomerular filtration alone. Increasing the concentration of probenecid to 3.0 mM does not significantly further increase the rate of excretion of platinum. The inclusion of furosemide 0.3 mM in the perfusate has no effect on the net tubular transport of platinum. However, at 3.0 mM furosemide causes a decrease in the net platinum transport and only 93% of platinum filtered at the glomerulus appears in the urine. Thin-layer chromatography revealed the presence of at least three platinum compounds in the urine in addition to cisplatin. We conclude that the renal excretion of cisplatin and its transformation products, even in this model system, is a complex process involving glomerular filtration, tubular excretion and tubular reabsorption.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6889863/,

Stents were shown to increase medical costs over 12 months in the early trials. Our aim was to determine the economic impact of an aggressive stenting strategy using current stenting techniques compared with a conservative stenting strategy. Initial and one year follow-up costs were determined in all patients who underwent successful revascularisation during June to December 1996 (aggressive stenting, n = 401), and compared to all patients treated in the corresponding months in 1995 (conservative stenting, n = 347). All patients had clinical follow-up for one year. The proportion of patients receiving a stent increased from 22.5% in 1995 to 66.1% in 1996 (p < 0.0001). Requirement for repeat procedures in the 1995 group compared with 1996 was coronary angiography in 31% vs 16% (p < 0.001), coronary angioplasty in 11% vs 6% (p = 0.0044) and bypass surgery in 4.8% vs 2.5% (p = 0.054). The mean initial cost of the procedure was higher in the aggressive stenting group ($4319 +/- 1276 in 1995 vs $5131 +/- 1491 in 1996, p < 0.0001), but after 12 months follow-up, total medical costs were equivalent ($5975 +/- 4143 in 1995 vs $5994 +/- 3476 in 1996, p = NS). An aggressive coronary stenting strategy is associated with higher initial costs compared with a conservative strategy, but lower costs during follow-up due to reduced need for repeat procedures, resulting in equivalent one year total medical costs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10342025/,

The Cavalieri method was used in combination with point counting to provide unbiased estimates of the volume of the left and right hippocampus, amygdala, temporal lobe, lateral ventricles and cerebral hemisphere, and pixel by pixel maps of the T2 relaxation time were computed for both central and anterior sections of the hippocampus. The 99th centiles of hippocampal volume, hippocampal volume asymmetry and T2 relaxation times in 20 control subjects provided limits which identified the presence of MTS. The results of the quantitative MRI were compared with the results of conventional diagnostic MRI, foramen ovale (FO) recording and the WADA test. Thirty-one patients were found to have unilateral MTS (17 left and 14 right) and 7 bilateral MTS. No evidence of MTS was detected in 16 patients. Of the 31 patients diagnosed with unilateral MTS on the basis of hippocampal volume and T2 measurement, 74% and 77% would respectively have received the same diagnosis on the basis of hippocampal volume and T2 measurements alone. In comparison to FO recording, quantitative MRI has a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 86%, while conventional diagnostic MRI has a sensitivity of 42% and a specificity of 80% for detection of MTS. Unilateral abnormalities were detected by FO recording in 30% cent of patients who appeared normal on quantitative MRI. WADA test results were available for 40 patients. The findings were consistent with quantitative MRI showing reduced memory function ipsilateral to unilateral MTS in 18 patients, but reduced memory function contralateral to unilateral MTS in two patients, and reduced memory function without MR abnormality in seven patients. WADA testing revealed unilateral memory impairments where MRI found bilateral pathology in 4 patients and in 4 patients in whom quantitative MRI detected unilateral MTS there was no evidence of reduced memory during WADA testing of the corresponding cerebral hemisphere. In the patients with unilateral right MTS a highly significant negative correlation (p = 0.0003) was observed between age of onset and the volume of the contralateral temporal lobe. Quantitative MR imaging of the hippocampus (i.e. volume and T2 measurement) is preferable to conventional radiological reporting for providing objective evidence of the presence of MTS on which to base the referral of patients for surgery, and since it has associated morbidity FO recording is now only being used in selected patients. Furthermore, stereology provides a convenient method for estimating the volume of other brain structures, which is relevant to obtaining a better understanding of the effects of laterality and age of onset of TLE.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167039/,

These reagents bound to nAcChR with Kd = 1.8 x 10(-8) and 2.3 x 10(-7) M for 1 and 2, respectively. In the presence of a metal, Fe(II)/Fe(III), and peroxide, both reagents produced a rapid and efficient half-of-sites inactivation of neurotoxin-binding sites in the nAcChR in a concentration-dependent manner, which paralleled the extent of receptor binding of the reagents. In the absence of Fe(II)/Fe(III) peroxide, redox-dependent inactivation occurred for both 1 and 2 more slowly and only at concentrations much higher (10(3)-10(4) times) than those necessary to produce significant binding to nAcChR. However, receptor inactivation in the absence of added metal peroxide was still more efficient for 1 and 2 than observed previously for [(trimethylammonio)methyl]catechol (3), the prototypic redox-dependent affinity reagent after which 1 and 2 were patterned. Thus, the new reagents reported are expected to provide more efficient and selective conditions for redox-dependent inactivation at nAcChR and other macromolecular sites to which such reagents may be directed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996555/,

It contained a large number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including known carcinogens [e.g., benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(j)fluoranthene]. The dose-related carcinogenic activity of this condensate was established after chronic epicutaneous application to mouse skin. We conclude that the manufacture and use of coloquint tar and related compounds may involve a health hazard and could lead to the development of cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746706/,

The recent report of N-cadherin mRNA expression in the mouse testis implies the involvement of this known adhesion molecule in testicular cell binding. Accordingly, here we report that (1) N-cadherin is found on the surface membranes of rat spermatogenic cells and on Sertoli cells, and (2) that N-cadherin is a partial mediator of Sertoli cell-germ cell adhesion as tested in an vitro cell-cell binding assay. Antiserum directed against the N-cadherin cell adhesion recognition sequence was used for Western blot anlaysis of purified plasma membranes from Sertoli cells and from spermatogenic cells. Both membrane preparations exhibited reactivity at an appropriate M(r) of about 130 kDa. In addition, immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that both germ cells and Sertoli cells were labeled by anti-N-cadherin. Finally, the antiserum was included in a cytometer-assisted cell-cell binding test to determine its inhibitory ability. The antiserum consistently reduced specific testicular cell-cell adhesion by 30%-50%. This is the first demonstration that antibodies directed against the cadherin cell adhesion recognition sequence are capable of inhibiting cell-cell interactions. Pre-incubation of either rat Sertoli cells or spermatogenic cells alone was sufficient to achieve statistically significant inhibition of intercellular adhesion. We conclude, therefore, that N-cadherin is expressed by both Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells and that N-cadherin is one of a number of regulatory molecules mediating local cellular associations in the mammalian seminiferous tubule.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400407/,

Six patients had a primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo; ten patients had therapy-related MDS and/or AML (t-MDS/t-AML), and one patient had chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast phase. Two of the six patients with MDS or AML de novo had extensive exposure to industrial solvents, and one patient had Seckel syndrome. The primary diagnoses for the ten patients with t-MDS/t-AML were breast carcinoma and Hodgkin's disease in two patients each, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma in one patient each. Four patients had received both prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy, four others received prior chemotherapy only, and the remaining two patients only prior radiotherapy. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of centromere-specific probes for chromosomes 5 and 17 revealed that a dicentric rearrangement was the most common (13/16 patients examined). The genetic consequences of these chromosomal rearrangements are partial monosomy for 5q and 17p. Two of six patients examined had point mutations in TP53, suggesting that loss of function of TP53 in addition to loss of a tumor suppressor gene on 5q may be involved in the pathogenesis of the malignant disease in some of these patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9365836/,

The oligomers included 15-mers and 30-mers of polydA, polydT, polydG, and polydC. Interactions between the dyes and DNA hybrids formed from complementary homogeneous strands of equal length were also investigated. No interactions were observed between the dyes and the monomeric monophosphate nucleosides A, G, T, or C. The dyes were found to interact much more strongly with the purine oligomers polydA and polydG than with the pyrimidine oligomers polydT and polydC. PolydA of both lengths has strong interactions with YOYO, whereas the polydG 30-mer interacts strongly with monomeric YO. The 15-mers of polydG and polydC of both lengths show little interaction with either dye. Interactions of the dyes with the polydA/polydT and polydG/polydC hybrids tend to be dominated by interactions with polydA and polydG, respectively. Although dye interactions generally were facilitated by hybridization, particularly for polydA/polydT, the interactions were similar to those with the single strands and different from those that have been observed in long double-stranded DNA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9547011/,

Eighteen subjects were presented with a green dot on a computer screen, which they were required to point at and touch. In 20% of the trials, the location or the color of the target was altered at the onset of movement to this stimulus, requiring the participant to modify the initially programmed response according to specific motor instructions. In the 'location-go' group, the target changed in location and participants were instructed to reach the displaced stimulus by correcting their ongoing movement. In the 'location-stop' and 'color-stop' groups, subjects were instructed to interrupt their movement when the target changed location or color, respectively. Results showed that the latency of the first responses to the perturbation clearly depended on the stimulus attribute and not on the motor instruction tested: the response to color change was obtained about 80 ms later than both conditions involving location change.

Single and double Trp-Phe mutants of IIABMan and of the IIA domain were produced. Fluorescence emission studies revealed that Trp33 and Trp12 are the major fluorescence emitters, Trp69 is strongly quenched in the native protein and Trp182 strongly blue shifted, indicative of a hydrophobic environment. Stabilities of the Trp mutants of dimeric IIA(Man) and IIAB(Man) were estimated from midpoints of the GdmHCl-induced unfolding transitions and from the amount of dimers that resisted dissociation by SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), respectively. W12F exhibited increased stability, but only 6% of the wild-type phosphotransferase activity, whereas W33F was marginally and W69F significantly destabilized, but fully active. Second site mutations W33F and W69F in the background of the W12F mutation reduced protein stability and suppressed the functional defect of W12F.

Endothelial dysfunction and loss of arterial elasticity are early markers of hypertension and atherosclerosis. We studied the prevalence of these markers in 44 healthy, prepubertal (age 9+/-1.3 years) children, 22 with LBW for age. Endothelial function in skin was tested with the local application of acetylcholine (inducing endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and nitroglycerin (endothelium-independent vasodilation), and local perfusion changes were measured with the laser Doppler method. The elastic properties of the abdominal aorta and common carotid artery were measured with an ultrasonic vessel-wall tracking system. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was lower in children with LBW (88+/-33 perfusion units [PU]) than in normal-birthweight controls (133+/-34 PU, P<0.001). There was no difference in aortic or carotid elasticity between the 2 groups, but a negative correlation was found between birthweight and stiffness of the carotid artery wall (r=-0.45, P<0.01). Endothelium-independent vasodilation and blood pressure were similar in the 2 groups. Schoolchildren with a history of LBW show impaired endothelial function and a trend toward increased carotid stiffness.

In order to identify the origin of the adenohypophyseal cells in mammalian embryos prior to the formation of Rathke's pouch (RP), we labeled the rostral end of the neural plate and the adjacent area focally with DiI at the open neurula stage (9.5 dpc).

More recently event-related functional magnetic reasonance imaging (fMRI) has also been used for studying pain. Both designs severely limit the application of the technology to clinical pain states. Recently we demonstrated that monitoring time fluctuations of perceived pain could be used with fMRI to identify brain regions involved in conscious, subjective perception of pain. Here we extend the methodology to demonstrate that the same approach can be used to study clinical pain states. Subjects are equipped with a finger-spanning device to continuously rate and log their perceived pain during fMRI data collection. These ratings are convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to generate predictor waveforms with which related brain activity can be identified. Chronic low back pain patients and a normal volunteer were used. In one series of fMRI scans the patient simply lies in the scanner and indicates spontaneous fluctuations of the subjective pain. In other fMRI scans, a straight-leg raising procedure is performed to exacerbate the back pain. In the normal volunteer, fMRI scans were done during painful and non-painful straight-leg raisings. The results indicate the feasibility of differentiating between different pain states.

After angioscopic valvuloplasty in the latter group, the competent tributary vein was exposed and cut 1.5 cm distal to its insertion point on the GSV. The transected vein was anastomosed end to side to the GSV, which was ligated between the tributary insertion site and the anastomosis. Changes in venous hemodynamics, including venous filling index (VFI), ejection fraction (EF), and residual volume fraction (RVF), were analyzed by use of air plethysmography. In the 1-year follow-up, no venous thrombosis was detected in either group. In the valvuloplasty-only group, 22 (75.9%) limbs exhibited reflux in the proximal GSV; recurrent varicose veins were detected in 5 (17.2%) limbs.

In Exp. 1 microinjection of muscimol (6.25-400 ng in 1 microl) in the RVM dose-dependently decreased pain threshold of rats and the ED(50) for muscimol was the same in both the hot plate and tail immersion pain tests. In the hot plate test, but not in the tail immersion test, paw withdrawal latencies increased again with high doses of muscimol (75-400 ng). High doses also produced catalepsy. Exp. 2 examined the effects of muscimol (50 ng) and bicuculline (50 ng) over a range of formalin concentrations (0.25-4%) in the formalin test. Muscimol increased responsiveness to formalin and reduced the slope of the formalin dose-response relation. Bicuculline decreased responses to formalin and reduced the slope of the formalin dose-response relation. It is suggested that RVM cells with inhibitory projections to the dorsal horn are not subject to strong GABAergic influence under mild noxious stimulation. RVM cells are thus active, and spinal dorsal horn relay neurons are inhibited. On the other hand, intense noxious peripheral stimulation may stimulate the release of GABA onto RVM cells, which in turn shuts off descending inhibitory fibers to allow transmission of nociceptor input through the dorsal horn.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166967/,

A CO(2) laser thermal stimulator was used to deliver heat stimuli under radiometer feedback temperature control to the volar forearm. Each stimulus consisted of a 30 s controlled baseline interval (at 34 or 38 degrees C) followed by a stepped increase in temperature (to 46 or 47 degrees C for 1, 2 or 4 s). A run comprised one presentation of each of these12 different stimuli to different locations. Each experiment contained three runs. In runs 2 and 3, the stimulus intensity and duration at a given location were not changed, but the baseline temperature was alternated between 34 degrees C and 38 degrees C. The intensity of pain was rated using the technique of magnitude estimation. Mean normalized pain ratings for suprathreshold stimuli applied from the higher base temperature (1.03+/-0.03) were slightly greater than from the lower base temperature (0.96+/-0.03). In contrast, pain ratings to the 47 degrees C stimuli (1.11+/-0.03) were substantially greater than to the 46 degrees C stimuli (0.88+/-0.03). Thus a 4 degrees C change in baseline temperature has a smaller affect (about 8%) on pain ratings than a 1 degrees C change in stimulus temperature (about 27%). This suggests that variations in baseline skin temperature encountered in experimental and clinical pain states have only a minor impact on pain sensitivity to suprathreshold temperature-controlled stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166981/,

In analysis of airway function, intravenous administration of 3 microg/kg LTC4 for 1 hr induced airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine with airway wall thickening. Thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists ONO-NT-126 and ONO-8809 inhibited the LTC4-induced airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine in a dose-dependent manner, but not the airway wall thickening induced by LTC4, suggesting that the effect of LTC4 on bronchial hyperresponsiveness is likely to be mediated through TXA2.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10780891/,

Triadimefon was applied (41.1 to 46.4 micrograms/cm2) in 0.2 ml of acetone to areas comprising 3% of the body surface (7.0 to 14.5 cm2). Thirty-six animals were treated at the initiation of each study. Groups of three animals were subsequently killed at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hr after treatment. Skin from the treated area as well as blood, heart, liver, kidneys, remaining carcass, urine, and feces were analyzed for 14C by scintillation counting techniques. Based on 14C counts, triadimefon was lost more rapidly from the skin of young animals (t 1/2, 20 to 25 hr) than from the skin of adult animals (t 1/2, 29 to 53 hr). Recovery studies indicated that adult males, adult females, young males, and young females, respectively, absorbed 53, 82, 57, and 52% of the dose. The rest of the dose based on material balance was presumably lost by evaporation. Approximately 2.5 to 3.9% of the dose penetrated the skin in one hour and was available for absorption. The rate of entry triadimefon into blood was 2 to 2.5 times faster for young than that observed in adult animals. Elimination of it from blood was faster in the case of the young animals. Triadimefon was absorbed through the skins of the adult male, adult female, young male, and young female rats, respectively, at rates of 0.20, 0.50, 0.58, and 0.48 micrograms/hr/cm2 of skin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710492/,

A randomised trial was conducted to assess whether this would be significantly reduced by postoperative radiotherapy. Between 1985 and 1991, 76 patients who had undergone a simple mastectomy and axillary sampling, and whose tumours had been found to be grade III and node-positive, were randomised to receive postoperative radiotherapy to the chest wall and axilla or no further loco-regional treatment. Radiotherapy was delivered with 8 MV X-rays to the axilla and supraclavicular fossa and with 8 MeV electrons to the chest wall, to a dose of 45 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. All patients have been followed-up until death, or for a minimum of 10 years. All loco-regional recurrences occurred within the first 4 years after mastectomy. There were 26 such events in the 40 patients randomised to the 'watch' policy (65%), as opposed to 9 out of 36 (25%) who received radiotherapy (P<0.01). Ten-year survival was 39% in the radiotherapy arm as opposed to 25% in the no radiotherapy arm. Recruitment to the trial was closed in 1991, when a preliminary safety analysis revealed the size of the effect of radiotherapy, and from then on all node-positive patients with grade III tumours have routinely been given this treatment. Further follow-up has confirmed this finding, as borne out by these 10-year results, which shows that radiotherapy has a significant impact on reducing loco-regional recurrence in patients at high risk after mastectomy. There is an apparent survival benefit although, because of the small numbers in this trial, this has not reached statistical significance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12008199/,

To test the hypothesis that local presentation of growth-promoting molecules can direct axon specification, we cultured hippocampal neurons on substrates patterned with stripes of poly-L-lysine and either laminin (LN) or the neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule (NgCAM). Although undifferentiated neurites contacted both substrates equally, axons formed preferentially on LN or NgCAM. Time-lapse studies revealed that changes in the growth pattern of a cell indicative of axon specification began almost immediately after the growth cone of one of the neurites of the cell contacted LN or NgCAM. When cells were plated on alternating stripes of LN and NgCAM, cells with their somata on LN usually formed axons on NgCAM, whereas those with somata on NgCAM preferentially formed axons on LN. This suggests that the change from one axon-promoting substrate to another also provides a signal sufficient to specify the axon. These results demonstrate that contact with preferred substrate molecules can govern which neurite becomes the axon and thus direct the development of neuronal polarity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10414970/,

PMC3545801,Effects of metals on chromosomes of higher organisms.,"A Sharma, G Talukder",1987,Environmental mutagenesis,"An analysis of the available data on the clastogenic effects of metals and their compounds on higher organisms indicates some general trends. Following chronic exposure to subtoxic doses, a decrease in mitotic frequency and an increase in the number of chromosomal abnormalities are observed. These effects are usually directly proportional to the dose applied and the duration of treatment within the threshold limits. Recovery after acute treatment is inversely related to the dosage. The ultimate expression of the effects depends on certain factors, including the mode and vehicle of administration; the form administered; the test system used; the rate of detoxification, distribution, and retention in the different tissues; and interaction with foreign and endogenous substances as well as the mode of action with the biological macromolecules. In mammals, the clastogenic activity of the metals within each vertical group of the periodic table is directly proportional to the increase in atomic weight, electropositivity, and solubility of the metallic cations in water and lipids, except for Li and Ba. This pattern of inherent cytotoxicity increases with successive periods in the horizontal level. It is enhanced by the formation of covalent and coordinate covalent complexes by heavy metals with the biological macromolecules. In plants, the solubility of the metals in water is of much greater importance. The degree of dissociation of metallic salts and the rate of absorption affect significantly the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. In assessing the effects of environmental metal pollution, the presence of other metals and toxic chemicals and the level of nutrition should be taken into account, since in nature, metals occur in combination and these factors modify the cytotoxic effects to a significant extent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3545801/,

It is especially critical for the relative fluorescence intensities (RFI) of equal amounts of amino acids to be as similar as possible. While fluorescamine and naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA) have proven to be excellent fluorogenic reagents for amino acid detection, the effects of various factors such as organic solvent, buffer, and pH have never been rigorously evaluated with respect to normalizing the relative fluorescence intensities of individual amino acids. To this end, here we describe optimized fluorescamine and NDA derivatization reactions that enhance the accuracy of microplate-based detection of amino acids. For both fluorescamine and NDA, we have shown that the RFI values of 16 of 19 amino acids are greater than 70%. Although determination of tryptophan is problematic, this difficulty is overcome by the addition of beta-cyclodextrin to the NDA reaction.

We studied the effectiveness of a lower dose erythromycin treatment regime, 250 mg three times a day for seven days in the treatment of chancroid. Patients with genital ulcer disease presenting at Nairobi City council clinic between January and March, 1992 were recruited into the study. Swabs were taken from the ulcers for Haemophilus ducreyi and venous blood was screened for syphilis and HIV antibodies. A total of 219 patients were enrolled for the study and were reviewed on days seven and fourteen for side effects, bacteriological and clinical cure rates. 26.4% of the study population were HIV-1 seropositive. The treatment regime was well tolerated and effective in both HIV seropositive and seronegative patients. Complete bacteriological cure rate was achieved in Haemophilus ducreyi culture positives by day seven irrespective of the HIV serostatus. However, the clinical cure rate for HIV seropositive patients was 88% compared to 99% for seronegative patients (p<.001).

O2 breathing resulted in a decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and cardiac index (CI) without changing pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) or right and left ventricular ejection fractions (RVEF, LVEF). On the other hand, T administration was followed by a decrease in PVRI, an increase in CI, RVEF and LVEF. These effects of T were maintained during exercise. Although RVEF was inversely correlated with basal levels of PAP or PVRI, acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics were not correlated with significant changes in RVEF. These results suggest that T may be useful in the treatment of patients with COPD prone to develop cor pulmonale.

Thermal denaturation of this preparation causes a considerable increase (about 2-fold) in the content of the thermolabile fraction melting in the free DNA denaturation zone. The relative content of fast repetitions in the thermolabile fraction (1 hour after the beginning of experiment) is lower than that in control. The type of changes in the viscosity of chromatin in the predenaturation zone isolated one hour later suggests a more labile binding of DNA to the protein. Chromatin preparation isolated 3 hours after cycloheximide injection is characterized by intermediate values of all parameters under study, as compared to the two other preparations used in this experiment. It is assumed that the activation of transcription coupled with the inhibition of translation by cycloheximide is determined by the appearance of elongated segments of free or weakly bound DNA in the chromatin preparation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204695/,

The mean time of insertion was 94 s (SD 108, range 15-420). Carotid artery puncture on two occasions controlled by firm pressure was the only complication. Arterial blood pressure, PaCO2, PaO2, and jugular venous bulb oxygen saturations (SjVO2) were intermittently measured at set intervals throughout the operation. We defined cerebral venous desaturation as 1) none (SjVO2 > 50%), 2) mild (45% < SjVO2 < 50%), and 3) severe (SjVO2 < 45%). We graded the usefulness of the catheter as 1) not useful (NU), SjVO2 > 50% and PaCO2 > 25 mm Hg; 2) useful (U1), SjVO2 > 50% and PaCO2 < 25 mm Hg; intervention, no increase in PaCO2; 3) useful (U2), SjVO2 < 50% and PaCO2 < 25 mm Hg; intervention, increase PaCO2 to improve SjVO2; 4) useful (U3), SjVO2 < 50% and PaCO2 > 25 mm Hg; intervention, nonventilatory action to increase SjVO2 (e.g., infusion of mannitol). Mild desaturation was detected in 24 patients and severe desaturation was present in 17 patients. We found SjVO2 monitoring to be useful in 60 of 99 patients studied. It was useful for detecting and treating cerebral venous desaturation in 13 of 18 patients with intracranial hematomas (subdural, epidural, and intracerebral hematomas), 9 of 18 patients with intracerebral tumors, 27 of 45 patients with cerebral aneurysms, and 6 of 8 patients with other intracranial pathology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7943786/,

Supplementum,"The efficacy of a new administration form of oxymetazoline, a nasal bellows container, was investigated in two separate studies by means of a combined treatment with phenoxymethyl-penicillin for acute maxillary sinusitis. In the first study (study 1), oxymetazoline administered with a bellows (OXBE) was compared both with a placebo belows (PLBE) as well as with oxymetazoline and placebo administered with a conventional nasal spray (OXSP respective PLSP) in 73 patients. In the second study (study 2), OXBE was compared only with PLBE in 48 patients. Objective evaluation was made by comparing the radiographical improvement in conventional plain sinus X-ray images. A scoring system corresponding to the outcome of antral irrigation was used for evaluating the X-ray pictures. Subjective symptoms; nasal stuffiness and pain, were assessed by registrations on visual analogue scales. Neither with regard to radiographical improvement nor to decrease in subjective symptoms could any significant differences be found between the different treatment modes. Oxymetazoline administered with a nasal bellows thus did not accelerate the rate of healing of acute maxillary sinusitis in these two studies.

The needs and experiences of such caregivers have been little studied with respect to major chronic mood disorders. A sample of caregivers (n=41) of RDC bipolar disorder was systematically interviewed to determine how this role affected them. Caregivers reported significant difficulties in their relationships with the patient when s/he was unwell, with considerable impact on their own employment, finances, legal matters, co-parenting and other social relationships. Violence was a particular worry for partner/parent caregivers of both male and female patients when the patient was manic. The caregiver's own mental health appeared unaffected. Despite this, the caregivers appeared emotionally committed to the patients and showed considerable tolerance of problem behaviours, which they rank-ordered for difficulty. Among nonfamily partners, knowledge of the illness before cohabitation was poor. The sampling does not capture caregivers who have abandoned their role, such as spouses who have divorced the bipolar sufferer. Management of this illness requires a partnership between mental health professionals and the informal caregivers and the authors suggest that each group needs to understand the difficulties encountered by the other.

Cell physiology,"Ca(+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) has been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contractility. The goals of this study were to determine: 1) to what extent CaM kinase II is activated by contractile stimuli in intact arterial smooth muscle, and 2) the effect of a CaM kinase II inhibitor (KN-93) on CaM kinase II activation, phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains (MLC(20)), and force. Both histamine (1 microM) and KCl depolarization activated CaM kinase II with a time course preceding maximal force development, and suprabasal CaM kinase II activation was sustained during tonic contractions. CaM kinase II activation was inhibited by KN-93 pretreatment (IC(50) approximately 1 microM). KN-93 inhibited histamine-induced tonic force maintenance, whereas early force development and MLC(20) phosphorylation responses during the entire time course were unaffected. Both force development and maintenance in response to KCl were inhibited by KN-93. Rapid increases in KCl-induced MLC(20) phosphorylation were also inhibited by KN-93, whereas steady-state MLC(20) phosphorylation responses were unaffected. In contrast, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) did not activate CaM kinase II and PDBu-stimulated force development was unaffected by KN-93. Thus KN-93 appears to target a step(s) essential for force maintenance in response to physiological stimuli, suggesting a role for CaM kinase II in regulating tonic contractile responses in arterial smooth muscle.

It is hypothesized that poor writers are less effective in the inhibition of neuromotor noise. Evidence for this theory is found in an analysis of electronically sampled handwriting movements of 48 children from grade 2, 3 and 4 (mean ages 8, 9 and 10, resp.). Twenty-four were poor and 24 were good writers, as judged by their teachers. Subjects were matched on age, sex, handedness and educational level. They performed handwriting tasks consisting of simple garlands and arcades, or meaningless words built from the letters 'e', 'n' and 'm'. In the tasks stroke accuracy, size and rotational direction were systematically varied. The results reveal that movement times were not different between the two groups, but poor writers and good writers used different movement strategies. Movements of the less proficient children were larger and were produced with higher movement velocities. Power Spectral Density Analysis disclosed that handwriting movements of poor writers were substantially more noisy than those of proficient writers, with a consistent peaking of the noise energy in that region of the spectrum which is representative for neuromotor tremor. Also, poor writers were less successful in adapting the level of noise to increased accuracy demands of the tasks.

Moreover, the activation of the GABAA receptor complex by different ligands has been shown to exert a negative influence on the POMC gene expression at the hypothalamic level. In order to elucidate the in vivo regulation of the POMC mRNA levels in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary by endogenous ligands of the GABAA receptor complex, we have studied the effect of intravenous (i.v.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injections of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), a peptide derived from diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI). The possible involvement of neurosteroids in the action of ODN on melanotropic cells was evaluated following inhibition of two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of neurosteroids known as activators of G3BAA receptor complex: trilostane, an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), and MK-906, an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase. The i.v. injection of ODN produced a dose-dependent inhibition of POMC gene expression in the IL. The i.c.v. injection of ODN also depressed POMC mRNA. These effects were completely reversed by the concomitant administration of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin. Similar results were obtained in POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (AN) of the hypothalamus. Trilostane administration induced an increase in POMC mRNA and also prevented the inhibitory influence of ODN. The neurosteroid pregnenolone-sulfate, a negative modulator of the GABAA receptor, also stimulated POMC gene expression. On the other hand, MK-906 produced a decrease in mRNA levels and could not reverse the effect of ODN. The results indicate that activation of the GABAA receptor complex by the endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand ODN can induce a negative regulation of POMC gene expression in the IL of the pituitary and neurons in the AN. The present results do not provide clear evidence that neurosteroids are involved in the action of ODN on POMC gene expression in the IL.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098553/,

The effects of both self-focusing and normative information concerning alcohol use were assessed in a 2 (self-focusing information: present, absent) x 2 (normative information: present, absent) factorial design. A significant two-way interaction on both a Decisional Balance Measure (DBM) and the Contemplation subscale of the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) revealed that relative to a control condition, either type of information presented alone increased negative evaluations of drinking and problem recognition, whereas presenting both types of information together had less effect on negative evaluations and even decreased problem recognition. The interaction obtained with DBM scores was further qualified by a three-way interaction that limited this pattern to participants scoring higher on self-deception. The same interactive pattern of self-focusing by normative information on problem recognition approached statistical significance on the Precontemplation subscale. Finally, a thinking-aloud procedure employed to obtain immediate reactions to the presentation of experimental information offered corroborative results, with the joint presentation of self-focusing and normative information triggering the most defensive reactions.

GPA variant erythrocyte frequencies (Vf), reflecting GPA allele loss (phi/N) and allele loss and duplication (N/N) somatic mutations arising in vivo in the erythroid progenitor cells of individuals of GPA M/N heterozygous genotype, were flow cytometrically determined in peripheral blood samples from these subjects. Measurements of styrene exposure of the workers at the time of blood sampling showed a mean 8-h time-weighted average (TWA8-h) styrene concentration of 155 mg/m3 (37 ppm) in the breathing zone. Mean urinary concentrations of the styrene metabolites mandelic acid (MA) and mandelic acid plus phenyl glyoxylic acid (MA+PGA) were 4.4 mmol/liter (after workshift) and 2.1 mmol/liter (next morning), respectively. Multivariate analysis of covariance on log-transformed GPA Vf data with models allowing adjustment for age, gender, smoking status, and styrene exposure showed that N/N Vf were nearly significantly increased among all of the exposed workers (adjusted geometric mean, 6.3 per million versus 5.0 in the controls; P = 0.058) and were statistically significantly elevated (adjusted geometric mean, 6.8 versus 5.0 in the controls; P = 0.036) among workers classified into a high-exposure group according to personal TWA8-h concentration of styrene in the breathing zone of > or = 85 mg/m3 (20 ppm; Finnish threshold limit value). Women in this high exposure group showed especially elevated N/N Vf (adjusted geometric mean 8.5 versus 5.3 in control women; P = 0.020); this elevation was also significant if urinary MA+PGA of > or = 1.2 mmol/liter was used as the basis of classification (adjusted geometric mean, 8.3; P = 0.030). The occupational exposure could not be shown to influence phi/N Vf. Cigarette smoking was associated with significantly elevated GPA Vf among active smokers (P = 0.042 for phi/N and P = 0.020 for N/N) and among active and ex-smokers combined (P = 0.014 for N/N). Its influence on phi/N Vf was especially clear among active smokers in the control group (P = 0.005). An effect of smoking, nearly statistically significant, was also observed for the phi/N Vf of control ex-smokers (P = 0.055) and of all active and ex-smokers combined (P = 0.050). Thus, the two characterized chemical exposures experienced by this group of workers and controls appear to produce differential effects on the two independent classes of GPA variants enumerated in the assay. This result suggests that the genotoxicity of these agents is mediated, at least in part, by different genetic mechanisms. Styrene exposure is associated with a specific increase in GPA N/N Vf; these allele loss and duplication variants reflect predominantly somatic recombination mechanisms in erythroid progenitor cells. Tobacco smoke exposure in active and ex-smokers is also associated not only with an increase in N/N Vf but also with an increase in phi/N Vf, reflecting the induction of GPA gene-inactivating mutations, including point mutations and deletions. This finding is consistent with a broad mechanistic spectrum of tobacco smoke genotoxicity associated with this complex mixture of chemical mutagens. Finally, there was no detectable effect of age on phi/N Vf; however, a highly significant (P = 0.0002) increase in N/N Vf with age, even after adjustment for other variables, was observed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8896891/,

Local intra-arterial infusion of the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 25 nmol.ml-1.min-1) was performed in autoperfused segments of cat ileum for 60 min after 90 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Epithelial permeability was quantitated by measuring blood-to-lumen clearance of 51Cr-labeled EDTA, and microvascular dysfunction was assessed by measuring the clearance of protein from the vasculature into the interstitium. 125I-labeled albumin clearance from blood to lumen and histology were performed to further characterize the extent of intestinal dysfunction after reperfusion of the postischemic intestine in the presence and absence of L-NAME. Ischemia-reperfusion-induced mucosal and microvascular permeability increases were dramatically augmented by L-NAME infusion, and this effect was reversed by infusion of L-arginine (125 nmol.ml-1.min-1). Initiating L-arginine (but not D-arginine) infusion alone 10 min before reperfusion provided protection against ischemia-reperfusion-induced mucosal barrier dysfunction; however, this was not associated with a reduction in endogenous levels of L-arginine during ischemia-reperfusion. These data suggest that basal nitric oxide production is important in minimizing mucosal and microvascular barrier dysfunction associated with reperfusion of postischemic intestine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8430797/,

We have isolated in both Sindbis virus E2 and in Ross River virus E1 a series of suppressing mutations that adapt these two proteins to one another and allow increased levels of chimeric virus production. Two adaptive E1 changes in an ectodomain immediately adjacent to the membrane anchor and five adaptive E2 changes in a 12-residue ectodomain centered on Asp-242 have been identified. One change in Ross River virus E1 (Gln-411-->Leu) and one change in Sindbis virus E2 (Asp-248-->Tyr) were investigated in detail. Each change individually leads to about a 10-fold increase in virus production, and combined the two changes lead to a 100-fold increase in virus. During passage of a chimeric virus containing Ross River virus E1 and Sindbis virus E2, the E2 change was first selected, followed by the E1 change. Heterodimers containing these two adaptive mutations have a demonstrably increased degree of interaction with Sindbis virus nucleocapsids. In the parental chimera, no interaction between heterodimers and capsids was visible at the plasma membrane in electron microscopic studies, whereas alignment of nucleocapsids along the plasma membrane, indicating interaction of heterodimers with nucleocapsids, was readily seen in the adapted chimera. The significance of these findings in light of our current understanding of alphavirus budding is discussed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9445043/,

Twenty patients with HbH disease were studied. Methods applied included cation-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography for HbH levels, chemoluminescence for Epo concentration, immunoassay for sTfR concentration, and DNA analysis for alpha-globin genotype characterization. Serum Epo and sTfR levels were significantly elevated (46.6+/-26.8 IU/l and 5.6+/-1.8 mg/l, respectively) in patients with HbH disease compared to controls (9.2+/-3.3 IU/l and 1.8+/-0.7 mg/l, respectively). Epo and sTfR levels correlated positively with HbH concentration (r = 0.93 and 0.80, respectively). The highest Epo and sTfR values were observed in three patients with the highest HbH levels who all had nondeletion alpha-thalassemia mutations. Epo and sTfR levels are increased in patients with HbH disease; this increase is directly related to the HbH concentration that usually reflects the degree of globin polypeptide imbalance. The correlation of Epo, sTfR, and reticulocyte production index in these patients indicates that anemia in HbH disease mainly is caused by ineffective erythropoiesis and a mild degree of peripheral hemolysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9856674/,

Salicylate administration increased the rates of excretion of water, sodium, and chloride in the urine. Salicylate administration also increased the rate of excretion of potassium so that its clearance often exceeded that of creatinine. This enhancement of potassium excretion was dissociated from the alkalosis that accompanies salicyate toxicity. Administration of 5% CO(2) in inspired gas did not attenuate the excretion of potassium; injection of salicylate into one renal artery caused a unilateral kaliuresis. Phosphate excretion increased progressively after administration of salicylate. On several occasions the clearance of phosphate equalled that of creatinine. Salicylate reduced renal tubular glucose reabsorption. When salicylate was injected into a renal artery, a glycosuria occurred ipsilaterally at filtered loads of glucose far below the reabsorptive capacity of the dog kidney. Salicylate administration also was associated with early elevation of glucose, phosphate, and potassium concentration in plasma. Salicylate administration reduced the content of adenosine triphosphate in the renal medulla. Salicylate was concentrated within the medulla between 1.5 and 3 times that of the cortex, a gradient equal to that for chloride.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4750446/,

PMC11353732,The effects of bilateral hippocampal damage on fMRI regional activations and interactions during memory retrieval.,"E A Maguire, F Vargha-Khadem, M Mishkin",2001,Brain : a journal of neurology,"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we examined successful retrieval of real-world memories in a patient (Jon) with selective bilateral hippocampal pathology resulting from perinatal hypoxia compared with healthy control subjects. Jon activated the same brain regions during memory retrieval as control subjects, both medial and lateral on the left. In contrast to controls, Jon also activated many homologous regions on the right. In spite of having 50% volume loss bilaterally in his hippocampi, retrieval in Jon was associated with increased activation of the hippocampi. Furthermore, hippocampal activity, as with the controls, was differential, being most responsive to retrieval of autobiographical events compared with other memory types (autobiographical facts, public events, general knowledge). Jon made a distinction between events that the control subjects did not make, namely that some of the autobiographical and public events he clearly remembered, while others he found that he knew about but did not truly remember. His hippocampi and medial frontal cortex were significantly more active during retrieval of events for which he had clear and conscious recollection compared with those he knew as much about, including the context, but could not remember experiencing. Although Jon activates the same network of brain regions as the controls (albeit bilaterally), and with the same pattern of response in the hippocampus, the communication between regions differs from controls with regard to hippocampal-cortical connectivity. In controls there was increased effective connectivity between parahippocampal cortex and hippocampus, specifically during the retrieval of autobiographical events. In contrast, this increase was not apparent in Jon; rather, retrieval of autobiographical events elicited greater interaction between the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, and also increased interaction between retrosplenial and medial frontal cortex. This study underlines the value of scanning patients using fMRI while they undertake tasks they can perform, in this case allowing us to confirm the functionality of remaining tissue in the damaged hippocampi, and to appreciate the neural basis of a distinction (remember/know) that control subjects do not make. Besides refining our knowledge of the hippocampal role in autobiographical event memory, this study indicates that recruitment of bilateral regions during memory retrieval, and altered patterns of effective connectivity between brain regions may be important indicators of disordered memory.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,

We have previously shown that P. gingivalis can degrade the epithelial cell-cell junction complexes, thus suggesting that this bacterium can invade the underlying connective tissues via a paracellular pathway. However, the precise mechanism(s) involved in this process has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine if the arginine- and lysine-specific gingipains of P. gingivalis (i.e., HRgpA and RgpB, and Kgp, respectively) were responsible for the degradation of E-cadherin, the cell-cell adhesion protein in the adherens junctions. In addition, we compared the degradative abilities of the whole gingipains HRgpA and Kgp to those of their catalytic domains alone. In these studies, immunoprecipitated E-cadherin as well as monolayers of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell cultures were incubated with the gingipains and hydrolysis of E-cadherin was assessed by Western blot analysis. Incubation of P. gingivalis cells with immunoprecipitated E-cadherin resulted in degradation, whereas prior exposure of P. gingivalis cells to leupeptin and especially acetyl-Leu-Val-Lys-aldehyde (which are arginine- and lysine-specific inhibitors, respectively) reduced this activity. Furthermore, incubation of E-cadherin immunoprecipitates with the different gingipains resulted in an effective and similar hydrolysis of the protein. However, when monolayers of MDCK cells were exposed to the gingipains, Kgp was most effective in hydrolyzing the E-cadherin molecules in the adherens junction. Kgp was more effective than its catalytic domain in degrading E-cadherin at 500 nM but not at a lower concentration (250 nM). These results suggest that the hemagglutinin domain of Kgp plays a role in degradation and that there is a critical threshold concentration for this activity. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the gingipains, especially Kgp, are involved in the degradation of the adherens junction of epithelial cells, which may be important in the invasion of periodontal connective tissue by P. gingivalis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11953390/,

Forty-two colorectal tumors, previously found to have high-degree MSI at dinucleotidic repeat loci, were revisited with BAT26, a mononucleotide marker, and the number of shifted bases were counted. Seven tumors, all with local stages at diagnosis, had < or =6-bp deletions and consistently displayed shorter shifts also with other intronic mononucleotide markers. Analysis of mononucleotide tracts in the coding regions of MSH3, MSH6, BAX, and TGFbetaRII in the groups with large (>6 bp) and short (< or =6 bp) allelic shifts showed specific patterns of involvement for the individual genes: TGFbetaRII displayed a uniformly high rate of mutations, while MSH3, MSH6, and BAX were less frequently altered in tumors with short shifts. Our findings suggest that microsatellite instability arises gradually, evenly involving loci with similar features of length and repetition.

Such variations have been shown to greatly alter the response to radiant heat stimuli when the temperature of the stimulus is not controlled. We carried out a psychophysical investigation to examine the influence of baseline skin temperature on pain ratings to temperature-controlled heat stimuli. A CO(2) laser thermal stimulator was used to deliver heat stimuli under radiometer feedback temperature control to the volar forearm. Each stimulus consisted of a 30 s controlled baseline interval (at 34 or 38 degrees C) followed by a stepped increase in temperature (to 46 or 47 degrees C for 1, 2 or 4 s). A run comprised one presentation of each of these12 different stimuli to different locations. Each experiment contained three runs. In runs 2 and 3, the stimulus intensity and duration at a given location were not changed, but the baseline temperature was alternated between 34 degrees C and 38 degrees C. The intensity of pain was rated using the technique of magnitude estimation. Mean normalized pain ratings for suprathreshold stimuli applied from the higher base temperature (1.03+/-0.03) were slightly greater than from the lower base temperature (0.96+/-0.03). In contrast, pain ratings to the 47 degrees C stimuli (1.11+/-0.03) were substantially greater than to the 46 degrees C stimuli (0.88+/-0.03). Thus a 4 degrees C change in baseline temperature has a smaller affect (about 8%) on pain ratings than a 1 degrees C change in stimulus temperature (about 27%). This suggests that variations in baseline skin temperature encountered in experimental and clinical pain states have only a minor impact on pain sensitivity to suprathreshold temperature-controlled stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166981/,

Therefore, the effects of combination therapy with halothane and a calcium antagonist (nifedipine), or a Na+/H+ inhibitor (HOE 694), or a Na+/Ca2+ inhibitor (quinacrine) on postcardioplegic functional recovery were evaluated. The isolated perfused rat heart subjected to 45 minutes normothermic cardiac arrest was used as an experimental model. Dose-response curves were performed for each drug. Using the optimal dosage for each drug, the following results were obtained: (1) Nifedipine (10(-7) M; administered retrogradely 10 minutes before and after cardioplegia) and halothane (1.5% administered during cardioplegia), when administered separately, improved functional recovery. Combination therapy did not further improve protection. (2) HOE 694 (10(-7) M) or quinacrine (10(-9) M) improved post-cardioplegic functional recovery when added for 2 minutes at the onset of reperfusion. Simultaneous administration of HOE 694 and 1.5% halothane was the only combination that yielded additive protection. (3) Quinacrine, a phospholipase and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, appeared to be the most powerful drug used. In summary, the results obtained indicate that interventions aimed at preventing intracellular Ca2+ overload improve recovery after cardioplegic arrest. The beneficial effects of halothane could be further improved by HOE 694.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9784906/,

They were compared to each other and to normal controls on measures of expressive and receptive language and on preception of word-initial and word-final voicing contrasts. There were significant differences among the groups on several imitative expressive language measures, with the syllable reducers making both deletion and substitution errors and the substituters making substitution errors for functors. There were no significant differences on a receptive language measure, nor in perception of final voicing contrasts, but the articulation-disordered groups performed more poorly than the controls in perception of initial voicing contrasts. Children's familiarity with the stimulus words of the perception task was related to their performance on language measures.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the dynamics of alpha-SMA expression in human basal cell epithelioma (BCE) cells and their surrounding stromal cells, in the process of differentiation towards cutaneous appendages such as hair, sebaceous, apocrine and eccrine glands. Using anti-alpha-SMA specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), 17 of 36 BCEs (47%) were shown to express alpha-SMA, despite the usual absence of alpha-SMA in all eukaryotic cells except muscle cells. Solid, adenoid and sclerosing types of BCE expressed alpha-SMA more frequently, and in greater amount, than cystic, keratotic and superficial types. Furthermore, the expression of alpha-SMA in BCE cells significantly paralleled the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in these cells. Thus, the altered expression of alpha-SMA may reflect the growing properties of BCE cells under the specific cellular regulations for differentiation. In addition, we have found anti-alpha-SMA MAb-positive fibroblasts with smooth muscle differentiation (myofibroblasts) in desmoplastic stroma surrounding BCE nests in 13 of 36 cases (36%). Coincidental expression of alpha-SMA in both BCE cells and stromal cells was found in nine of the 13 cases (69%), indicating the possibility of the induction of myofibroblastic stromal changes in surrounding tissues by cytokines secreted from BCE cells [e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-like factor].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907224/,

Fibroblasts were used to study alterations in the traffic of class I MHC complexes induced by Nef. We found that Nef downregulates class I MHC complexes by a novel mechanism involving the accumulation of endocytosed class I MHC in the trans-Golgi, where it colocalizes with the adaptor protein-1 complex (AP-1). This effect of Nef on class I MHC traffic requires the SH3 domain-binding surface and a cluster of acidic amino acid residues in Nef, both of which are also required for Nef to downregulate class I MHC surface expression and to alter signal transduction in T cells. Downregulation of class I MHC complexes from the surface of T cells also requires a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the class I MHC heavy chain molecule. The requirement of the same surfaces of the Nef molecule for downregulation of surface class I MHC complexes in T cells and for their accumulation in the trans-Golgi of fibroblasts indicates that the two effects of Nef involve similar interactions with the host cell machinery and involve a molecular mechanism regulating class I MHC traffic that is common for both of these cell types. Interestingly, the downregulation of class I MHC does not require the ability of Nef to colocalize with the adaptor protein-2 complex (AP-2). We showed previously that the ability of Nef to colocalize with AP-2 correlates with the ability of Nef to downregulate CD4 expression. Our observations indicate that Nef downregulates class I MHC and CD4 surface expression via different interactions with the protein sorting machinery, and link the sorting and signal transduction machineries in the regulation of class I MHC surface expression by Nef.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9582271/,

Between 1 January 1983 and 30 June 1996, 188 consecutive patients with TAAA were operated on, of whom 23 (12%) were operated for rupture. There were nine survivors (40%). Patients whose preoperative systolic blood pressure remained above 100 mmHg were significantly more likely to survive (4/8 vs. 13/15, p = 0.03 by Fisher's exact test). Survival was also related to Crawford type: type I (two of three survived); II (none of six); III (two of six); and IV (five of eight). All non-type II, non-shocked patients survived operation. Survivors spent a median of 28 (range 10-66) postoperative days in hospital, of which a median of 6 (range 2-24) days were spent in the intensive care unit. Survivor morbidity comprised prolonged ventilation (> 5 days) (n = 3); tracheostomy (n = 1); and temporary haemofiltration (n = 2). No survivor developed paraplegia or required permanent dialysis. Patients in shock with a Crawford type II aneurysm have such a poor prognosis that intervention has to be questioned except in the most favourable of circumstances.

To determine if PI is an essential phospholipid of mycobacteria, we identified the pgsA gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis encoding the phosphatidylinositol synthase enzyme and constructed a pgsA conditional mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis. The ability of this mutant to synthesize phosphatidylinositol synthase and subsequently PI was dependent on the presence of a functional copy of the pgsA gene carried on a thermosensitive plasmid. The mutant grew like the control strain under permissive conditions (30 degrees C), but ceased growing when placed at 42 degrees C, a temperature at which the rescue plasmid is lost. Loss of cell viability at 42 degrees C was observed when PI and phosphatidylinositol dimannoside contents dropped to approximately 30 and 50% of the wild-type levels, respectively. This work provides the first evidence of the essentiality of PI to the survival of mycobacteria.

Host CD11c+ DCs were rapidly activated and aggregated in the T cell areas of the spleen within 6 hours of lethal irradiation. By 5 days after irradiation, <1% of host DCs were detectable, but the activated donor CD8+ T cells had already undergone as many as seven divisions. Thus, proliferation of donor CD8+ T cells preceded the disappearance of host DCs. When C3H.SW donor CD8+ T cells were primed in vivo in irradiated B6 mice or ex vivo by host CD11c+ DCs for 24-36 hours, they were able to proliferate and differentiate into IFN-gamma-producing cells in beta(2)-microglobulin-deficient (beta(2)m(-/-)) B6 recipients and to mediate acute GVHD in beta(2)m(-/-) --> B6 chimeric mice. These results indicate that, although host DCs disappear rapidly after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, they prime donor T cells before their disappearance and play a critical role in triggering donor CD8+ T cell-mediated GVHD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12021249/,

In this report, we establish that FKBP12 mediates FK506 inhibition of both calcineurin phosphatase activity and IgE activation-induced cytokine transcripts in a Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cell line that is FKBP12 deficient. Overexpression of FKBP12 by transfection enhanced the ability of FK506 to inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity (IC50 = 2 nM), compared with cells transfected with the expression vector alone (IC50 > 30 nM). The IC50 value for FK506 inhibition of IgE activation-induced transcripts for TNF-alpha decreased from 40 nM in vector control cells to 10 nM in FKBP12 transfectants. Similarly, the IC50 value for inhibition of IL-6 transcripts decreased from > 1000 nM in vector control cells to 35 nM in FKBP12 transfectants. In contrast, activation-elicited release of the secretory granule mediator beta-hexosaminidase was only partially inhibited by FK506 at 1000 nM, regardless of the levels of FKBP12 expressed by the cells.

Cell association was greatest during a short period in the late log phase of growth under aerobic conditions. At this time, the pH of the growth medium was changing from acid to alkaline and glucose (0.2% initially) was exhausted. Addition of excess glucose (0.5%) to brain heart infusion broth, which was not exhausted before the bacteria entered the stationary phase of growth, in which cell association dropped sharply, resulted in repression of cell association by the bacteria. The repressive effect of glucose on cell association could not be reversed by exogenous cyclic AMP in the bacterial growth medium. Under anaerobic conditions, the effect of glucose on cell association by the bacteria was not as great and the glucose was not exhausted before the bacteria entered the stationary phase. When S. typhimurium was grown in a rich but carbohydrate-free medium, cell association by the bacteria increased earlier in the growth cycle under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The addition of glucose and certain other utilizable carbohydrates to this medium caused a repression of cell association by S. typhimurium that was greater under aerobic growth conditions. These results show that cell association by S. typhimurium, which is accompanied by rapid internalization (cell invasion), is the same under aerobic and anaerobic conditions if the bacteria are grown to the log phase in a carbohydrate-free medium. This suggests that prior reports of greater cell invasion by S. typhimurium during anaerobic growth may have arisen from the use of media containing carbohydrates which were found to be more repressive during aerobic growth of the bacteria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7890410/,

In the presence of the impermeant anion gluconate, glutamate pulses activated smaller currents predicted to result from stoichiometric flux of cotransported ions.

In the present study, we first used immunoprecipitation with a variety of antibodies against N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to show that tyrosine-phosphorylated subunits of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor are protected against calpain-mediated truncation of their C-terminal domains. A GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain of NR2A was used to identify the calpain cutting sites in the C-terminal domain. One site was identified at residues 1278-1279, corresponding to one of the preferred calpain truncation sites. This site is adjacent to a consensus sequence for Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, and Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the GST-NR2A C-terminal fusion protein also inhibited calpain-mediated truncation of the fusion protein. We propose that phosphorylation of NR2 subunits and the resulting inhibition of calpain-mediated truncation of their C-terminal domains provide for the stabilization of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in postsynaptic structures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10846184/,

In the hot plate test, but not in the tail immersion test, paw withdrawal latencies increased again with high doses of muscimol (75-400 ng). High doses also produced catalepsy. Exp. 2 examined the effects of muscimol (50 ng) and bicuculline (50 ng) over a range of formalin concentrations (0.25-4%) in the formalin test. Muscimol increased responsiveness to formalin and reduced the slope of the formalin dose-response relation. Bicuculline decreased responses to formalin and reduced the slope of the formalin dose-response relation. It is suggested that RVM cells with inhibitory projections to the dorsal horn are not subject to strong GABAergic influence under mild noxious stimulation. RVM cells are thus active, and spinal dorsal horn relay neurons are inhibited. On the other hand, intense noxious peripheral stimulation may stimulate the release of GABA onto RVM cells, which in turn shuts off descending inhibitory fibers to allow transmission of nociceptor input through the dorsal horn.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166967/,

Similarly, SCH 39166 administered following PD 128,907 did not stimulate DA release, further decreasing ACh release. These results indicate that quinpirole or PD 128,907 affect the actions of SCH 39166 on DA and ACh release in opposite manner, counteracting the increase of DA release and potentiating the reduction of ACh release. These data support the tenet that endogenous DA exerts a stimulatory input on striatal ACh neurotransmission mediated by D1 receptors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,

However, it is difficult to resect a tumor which is huge and tightly invaded or adhered to the surrounding organs by classical procedures because of poor exposure. The purpose of the present study was to verify that retrograde hepatectomy was an acceptable approach. Retrograde hepatectomy means that the operative procedure is reversed as compared with classical methods. Transection of the liver parenchymal was performed first, isolating adhesions between the resected liver and diaphragm or partial phrenectomy followed, and then after cutting corresponding ligaments, the liver tumor was removed. If the adjacent organs were invaded or adhered too tightly to be separated, they were removed with the resected liver. This approach was adopted in 29 patients with liver malignancy (group A) for difficult hepatectomy from June 1994 to June 1997. In the same period, classical hepatectomy was performed in 13 patients used as a control group (group B). The differences between these two groups were analyzed. When group A was compared with group B, the operative mortality was 0% versus 7.7% (p > 0.05), the operative time was shorter, being 175.9 +/- 49.7 min (range: 150-250 min) versus 251.9 +/- 66.9 min (range: 180-360 min) (p < 0.05), the estimated intra-operative blood loss being 1430.0 +/- 807.6 ml (600-4200 ml) versus 2907.7 +/- 1497.9 ml (800-7000 ml) (p < 0.05), and the incidence of post-operative complications was lower (p < 0.05). Retrograde hepatectomy is an alternative method to classical hepatectomy and suitable for resection of localized huge liver tumor when the exposure is inadequate by classical approach, particularly when the tumor adheres or invades closely to the diaphragm and/or the surrounding structures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10370681/,

HTFP acts as an irreversible inhibitor of rabbit muscle aldolase: the loss of activity was time dependent and the inactivation followed a pseudo-first-order process. Values of 1.4 mM for the dissociation constant and 2.3 X 10(-2) s-1 for the reaction rate constant were determined. The kinetic constants do not depend on the enzyme concentration. No effect of thiols on the inactivation rate was detected. Only 1-2 mol of fluoride ions was liberated per inactivated subunit, indicative of a low partition ratio. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate protected the enzyme against the inactivation in a competitive manner, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate protected as if it formed a condensation product with HTPF. 5,5'-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) thiol titration showed the loss of one very reactive thiol group per enzyme subunit after inactivation.

CMCT was abnormal in 7 patients with OPCA and one with LOCA. CMCT abnormalities (43% of cases) and increased threshold (68%) were more often found within OPCA group than in another multisystem atrophy and LOCA. Reduction in amplitude of the response after TMS was significantly correlated with cerebral hemispheres's atrophy. Increased threshold was correlated with upper vermal hemisphere atrophy and enlargement of the fourth ventricle. Electrophysiologic signs of mixed peripheral neuropathy were found in 8 patients. TMS abnormalities were not related to peripheral nerve involvement. Marked variation in CMCT suggests heterogeneity in these diseases.

In addition, it appears that the NO formed by astroglial cells in which transcriptional induction of NOS has been evoked by cytokines affects NOS mRNA level. We have observed that induction in the presence of NOS inhibitors or NO-trapping agents amplifies NOS mRNA expression and that this effect is reversed by an NO donor. Rather than promoting mRNA instability, NO appears to inhibit the transcriptional induction of NOS. This effect of NO on induction of the NOS gene provides a mechanism by which the temporal and perhaps spatial production in the nervous system of NO, a reactive and potentially toxic mediator, can be finely regulated.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7516158/,

Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the V alpha 24 TCR repertoire was selectively used in CD4-CD8- double-negative T cells both in patients and in healthy individuals, while almost all families of TCR V alpha were expressed in single-positive T cell fractions. The V alpha 24+ double-negative T cells were increased by approximately fivefold in patients. However, sequence analysis clearly showed significant differences in the V alpha 24 TCR repertoire dominating in patients and healthy donors. In healthy individuals, the invariant V alpha 24J alpha Q was expanded and comprised 20-50% of the total TCR-alpha, while their selective reduction was observed in SSc patients who also showed expansion of invariant V alpha 24 TCR other than V alpha 24J alpha Q. Analogous to murine invariant V alpha 14J alpha 281 TCR, these results suggest that T cells with invariant V alpha 24J alpha Q TCR would function as regulatory T cells, whereas T cells bearing other invariant V alpha 24 TCR in SSc patients could be autoaggressive T cells in nature.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7561690/,

Two different categories of PKC activators were investigated: the cis-unsaturated fatty acids (CUFAs): oleic (cis-9-octadecenoic), linoleic (cis-9-12-octadecadienoic), and linolenic acid (cis-9-12-15-octadecatrienoic), and, the diacylglycerol (DAG) derivative 1-2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG). These substances caused the following alterations on Na+ currents: (i) Na+ currents were attenuated as a function of voltage. While DOG attenuated both inward and outward Na+ currents in a monotonic and continuous voltage-dependent manner, CUFAs preferentially attenuated inward currents; (ii) the steady-state activation curve of Na+ currents shifted to more depolarized voltages; (iii) opposite to the activation curve, the steady-state inactivation curve of Na+ channels (h curve) shifted to more hyperpolarized voltages; (iv) the time course of inactivation development was accelerated by PKC activators, while the recovery from inactivation was not affected; (v) substances that inhibit different metabolic pathways (PKC activation, cyclooxygenase, lipooxygenase, and P-450 pathways) did not prevent the effects of PKC activators on Na+ currents. One fully saturated fatty acid (octadecanoic acid), a trans-unsaturated fatty acid (trans-9-octadecenoic), and different phorbol esters did not affect Na+ currents; (vi) effects of different PKC activators on Na+ currents were completely reversible. These observations suggest that PKC activators might interact with Na+ channels directly. These direct effects must be taken into consideration in evaluating the overall effect of PKC activation on Na+ channels. Moreover, it is likely that this direct interaction could account, at least in part, for the diversity of effects of PKC activators on Na+ channels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7595942/,

If clinical improvement were observed, this therapy would then be used to treat patients with the short-bowel syndrome over the long term. Patients who undergo extensive resection of the gastrointestinal tract frequently develop malabsorption and require long-term parenteral nutrition. The authors hypothesized that the administration of growth factors and/or nutrients could enhance further compensation of the remnant intestine and thereby improve absorption. Specifically, animal studies have shown that there is enhanced cellularity with the administration of growth hormone (GH) or glutamine (GLN), or a fiber-containing diet. Initially, 17 studies were performed in 15 total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-dependent short-bowel patients over 3 to 4 weeks in the clinical research center; the first week served as a control period, and during the next 1 to 3 weeks, the specific treatment was administered and evaluated. Throughout the study, food of known composition was provided and all stool was collected and analyzed to determine absorption across the remaining bowel. The effect of a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (DIET), the amino acid glutamine (GLN) and growth hormone (GH) administered alone or in combination with the other therapies (GH + GLN + DIET) was evaluated. The treatment was expanded to 47 adults (25 men, 22 women) with the short-bowel syndrome, dependent on TPN for 6 +/- 1 years. The average age was 46 +/- 2 years, and the average jejunal-ileal length was 50 +/- 7 cm (median 35 cm) in those with all or a portion of colon and 102 +/- 24 cm (median 102 cm) in those with no colon. After 28 days of therapy, the patients were discharged on only GLN + DIET. The initial balance studies indicated improvement in absorption of protein by 39% accompanied by a 33% decrease in stool output with the GH + GLN + DIET. In the long-term study, 40% of the group remain off TPN and an additional 40% have reduced their TPN requirements, with follow-up averaging a year and the longest being over 5 years. GH + GLN + DIET offers a potential method for providing cost-effective rehabilitation of surgical patients who have the short-bowel syndrome or other complex problems of the gastrointestinal tract. This therapeutic combination also may be useful to enhance bowel function in patients with other gastrointestinal diseases and those requiring extensive intestinal operations, including transplantation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677455/,

This attempted cyclization failed, however, and yielded linear products instead. Characterization by mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, peptide sequencing and NMR indicated that the major products were the tetramethylguanidinium (Tmg) derivatives [Dab(Tmg)2,D-Glu3,Leu5]-enkephalinamide and the corresponding dimeric linear Tmg-containing peptide which resulted from the transfer of the tetramethyluronium moiety from HBTU to the amino side chain of Dab.

Six consecutive patients (three men, three women; mean age, 46 years, age range, 18-74 years) underwent arterial embolization of nine PAVMs with superselective catheterization with a 3-F coaxial catheter system and embolization with 0.018-inch microcoils. The PAVMs varied in size from 1 to 6 cm (mean, 2.5 cm). Five of the lesions were also treated by filling the venous sac with GDCs. Success and outcome were evaluated by means of a review of patient records, angiographic findings, and telephone interview results. Complete primary occlusion was achieved in eight of nine lesions; repeat embolization resulted in successful occlusion of one lesion. The superselective technique enabled successful embolization in one patient after a previous procedure performed with a 0.035-inch (Gianturco) coil had failed. Filling of the venous sac was performed in the presence of dilated draining veins and enabled successful occlusion of the feeding artery with microcoils in all cases. There were no complications. Superselective embolization with microcatheters allowed easy catheterization and safe coil deployment.

This investigation examined the autoregulatory efficiency of different vascular regions of the normotensive and stroke prone-spontaneously hypertensive rat (SP-SHR) kidney and determined how these myogenic responses were dependent upon extracellular calcium. In acute studies, renal autoregulatory blood perfusion curves for cortex and papilla were generated, autoregulatory indices (AI's) calculated as a ratio of the perfusion change divided by the ratio of the pressure difference where zero represents perfect and 1 equates to no autoregulation. The influence of a calcium channel antagonist on this AI was measured at both cortex and papilla. 2. Rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone, the kidney exposed and cortical and papillary perfusion measured by Laser-Doppler flowmetry. Groups of rats either received no drug or nitrendipine at either 0.125 or 0.25 micrograms kg-1 min-1. 3. In the Wistar normotensive rats there was efficient autoregulation in the cortex (AI = 0.21 +/- 0.17), from 127 to 90 mmHg, but not in the papilla (AI = 0.89 +/- 0.08), while below 90 mmHg perfusion in both regions decreased with renal perfusion pressure. Nitrendipine attenuated cortical autoregulation at the higher pressure range (AI = 0.62 +/- 0.13 and 0.92 +/- 0.10 at the low and high dose, respectively) while having no effect on the papillary pressure perfusion pattern. 4. In the SP-SHR, reduction in renal perfusion pressure, from 150 to 100 mmHg, gave a cortical AI of 0.49 +/- 0.10, indicating impaired autoregulation, whereas the papilla demonstrated little myogenic response. Over the high pressure range in the presence of both doses of nitrendipine there was neither cortical (AI of 0.75 +/- 0.11 and 0.94 +/- 0.12, respectively) nor papillary autoregulation. 5. Autoregulation in the renal cortex but not papilla of the young Wistar rats is well developed. The myogenic responses are attenuated by the calcium channel antagonists suggesting that they are dependent upon the availability of extracellular calcium. Cortical autoregulation in the SP-SHR is deficient compared to the normotensive rats and is further impaired by the calcium channel antagonists.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012687/,

Based on this, the theoretical sensitivity and specificity of GRE MR-mammography has been investigated considering different evaluation methods for the gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA)-based signal enhancement. The results show that both in- and out-of-phase sequences suffer from partial volume effects in voxels that contain both fat and water. This can decrease sensitivity to Gd-DTPA uptake in small, fat-embedded lesions or in pathology that contains fat interspersed histologically. Additionally, out-of-phase sequences can suffer from phase cancellation effects that can further decrease their sensitivity to Gd-DTPA uptake. In the worst case signal can actually decrease during Gd-DTPA influx. Determination of enhancement relative to the baseline value can decrease the specificity of GRE MR-mammography in the out-of-phase condition and decrease the sensitivity in the in-phase condition. These effects are less pronounced when enhancement is calculated relative to fat. These effects need to be understood since Gd-DTPA uptake is the prime indicator of malignancy in MR-mammography.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8875396/,

Blood flow and histological changes were determined. Vascular clamping of the spermatic cord in groups 2 and 3 resulted in a significant decrease in testicular blood flow compared to 720-degree torsion (p < 0.05). These flow changes correlated with more severe and reproducible gross changes, and histological features of seminiferous tubule degeneration compared to spermatic cord twisting. In the rat clamping the spermatic cord is a more severe and reproducible model of testicular torsion than 720-degree torsion. The contribution of the vasal vessels to the decrease in blood flow and resulting histological degeneration after testicular ischemia is negligible in the rat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9258157/,
PMC9503880,Multivariate life testing in variably scaled environments.,"P H Kvam, F J Samaniego",1997,Lifetime data analysis,"This paper examines modeling and inference questions for experiments in which different subsets of a set of kappa possibly dependent components are tested in r different environments. In each environment, the failure times of the set of components on test is assumed to be governed by a particular type of multivariate exponential (MVE) distribution. For any given component tested in several environments, it is assumed that its marginal failure rate varies from one environment to another via a change of scale between the environments, resulting in a joint MVE model which links in a natural way the applicable MVE distributions describing component behavior in each fixed environment. This study thus extends the work of Proschan and Sullo (1976) to multiple environments and the work of Kvam and Samaniego (1993) to dependent data. The problem of estimating model parameters via the method of maximum likelihood is examined in detail. First, necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of model parameters are established. We then treat the derivation of the MLE via a numerically-augmented application of the EM algorithm. The feasibility of the estimation method is demonstrated in an example in which the likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis of equal component failure rates within any given environment is carried out.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503880/,

We have identified a distinct open reading frame at the left end of RRV and designated it R1. The position of the R1 gene is equivalent to that of the saimiri transforming protein (STP) of herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) and of K1 of KSHV, other members of the gamma-2 or rhadinovirus subgroup of herpesviruses. The R1 sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a product of 423 amino acids that was predicted to contain an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail reflective of a type I membrane-bound protein. The predicted structural motifs of R1, including the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, resembled those in K1 of KSHV but were distinct from those of STP. R1 sequences from four independent isolates from three different macaque species revealed 0.95 to 7.3% divergence over the 423 amino acids. Variation was located predominantly within the predicted extracellular domain. The R1 protein migrated at 70 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was extensively glycosylated. Tagged R1 protein was localized to the cytoplasmic and plasma membranes of transfected cells. Expression of the R1 gene in Rat-1 fibroblasts induced morphologic changes and focus formation, and injection of R1-expressing cells into nude mice induced the formation of multifocal tumors. A recombinant herpesvirus in which the STP oncogene of HVS was replaced by R1 immortalized T lymphocytes to interleukin-2-independent growth. These results indicate that R1 is an oncogene of RRV.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10233975/,

Protein libraries are often encoded by chemically synthesized DNA, in which part of the open reading frame is randomized. There are, however, major obstacles associated with the chemical synthesis of long open reading frames, especially those containing random segments. Insertions and deletions that occur during chemical synthesis cause frameshifts, and stop codons in the random region will cause premature termination. These problems can together greatly reduce the number of full-length synthetic genes in the library. We describe a strategy in which smaller segments of the synthetic open reading frame are selected in vitro using mRNA display for the absence of frameshifts and stop codons. These smaller segments are then ligated together to form combinatorial libraries of long uninterrupted open reading frames. This process can increase the number of full-length open reading frames in libraries by up to two orders of magnitude, resulting in protein libraries with complexities of greater than 10(13). We have used this methodology to generate three types of displayed protein library: a completely random sequence library, a library of concatemerized oligopeptide cassettes with a propensity for forming amphipathic alpha-helical or beta-strand structures, and a library based on one of the most common enzymatic scaffolds, the alpha/beta (TIM) barrel.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10715203/,

We examined whether a simulated IV test dose containing bupivacaine instead of lidocaine, and isoproterenol instead of epinephrine, produces reliable changes in heart rate (HR) and T wave morphology. One hundred healthy infants and children (6-72 mo) were randomized to one of five groups (n = 20 each) during 1.0 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration sevoflurane and 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen: atropine pretreatment (0.01 mg/kg IV) followed by 0.25% bupivacaine containing epinephrine 0.5 microg/kg IV, atropine followed by normal saline, atropine followed by 1% lidocaine containing isoproterenol 0.1 microg/kg, saline pretreatment followed by the lidocaine-isoproterenol test dose, and saline followed by saline. HR was recorded every 20 s and T wave amplitude of lead II was continuously recorded. All patients receiving the bupivacaine-epinephrine test dose and none receiving saline met the HR (positive if > or =10 bpm increase) and T wave criteria (positive if > or =25% increase in amplitude). The isoproterenol-containing test dose produced positive responses based only on the HR criterion with or without atropine pretreatment. Our results indicate that HR and T wave changes are useful if a bupivacaine-epinephrine test dose is used and that HR is the only useful indicator if an isoproterenol-containing test dose is used in sevoflurane-anesthetized children. To determine if an epidurally administered local anesthetic has been unintentionally injected into a blood vessel, a small dose of epinephrine or isoproterenol may be added to a local anesthetic. We found that an increase in heart rate > or =10 bpm and an increase in T wave amplitude of lead II >or =25% are useful indicators for detecting accidental intravascular injection of an epinephrine-containing test dose in sevoflurane-anesthetized children, whereas only a heart rate change is a reliable diagnostic tool if an isoproterenol-containing test dose is used.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10960378/,

The AIDS pandemic, increased incidence of tuberculosis in populations with easy access to antituberculosis medications, the deterioration of the public health infrastructure, and inadequate training of health care providers in the epidemiology of tuberculosis are some of the factors contributing to the increased incidence of MDRTB. Mortality from MDRTB exceeds 80% in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but is also high in patients free of HIV. The management of MDRTB is complicated by the lack of methods for rapid detection of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The risk of infection among close contacts of patients with MDRTB, the probability of the development of active MDRTB after infection, and the likelihood of cure of MDRTB need to be determined quantitatively. Attributable risk estimates for factors associated with MDRTB should be calculated for each community as part of the strategies to prevent MDRTB. Issues regarding chemoprophylaxis in newly infected contacts of MDRTB cases remain unanswered.

To gain insight into the sex- and tissue-specific regulation of progesterone receptors, protein binding on a progesterone receptor-oestrogen response element and mRNA levels for progesterone receptor (PR)-A and PR-B were compared between female and male rats following oestradiol benzoate replacement treatment in hypothalamic and pituitary tissue. Both male and female pituitary protein extracts demonstrated an increase in nuclear protein binding activity to a progesterone receptor-oestrogen response element following oestradiol benzoate treatment. However, there was a greater difference in total binding activity seen in the female pituitary extracts compared to male pituitary protein extracts. In both cases, reflecting the binding data, oestradiol benzoate pretreatment led to an increase in pituitary PR-B messenger RNA, although this increase was significantly larger in females than in males. Oestradiol benzoate treatment also led to a significant increase in specific binding of hypothalamic nuclear proteins to the progesterone receptor oestrogen response element from both females and male hypothalamic extracts. In addition, PR-B messenger RNA was induced by oestradiol benzoate treatment in the female rat hypothalamus, under circumstances where no PR-A could be detected. The male also demonstrated an increase in PR-B messenger RNA following oestradiol benzoate treatment, with undetectable levels of PR-A, although to a lesser degree than that seen in the female. The predominance of PR-B over PR-A messenger RNA in rat hypothalamus and pituitary, and the quantitative differences between female and male rats, could both contribute to the greater responsiveness of female rats to progesterone with respect to control over luteinizing hormone release from the pituitary, and lordosis behaviour regulated by hypothalamic neurones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11999716/,

This makes it difficult to achieve an accurate registration between a functional activation map calculated from an EPI time series and an undistorted, high resolution anatomical image. A correction method based on mapping the spatial distribution of field inhomogeneities can be used to reduce these distortions. This approach is attractive in its simplicity but requires postprocessing to improve the robustness of the acquired field map and reduce any secondary artifacts. Furthermore, the distribution of the internal magnetic field throughout the head is position dependent resulting in an interaction between distortion and head motion. Therefore, a single field map may not be sufficient to correct for the distortions throughout a whole fMRI time series. In this paper we present a quantitative evaluation of image distortion correction for fMRI at 2T. We assess (i) methods for the acquisition and calculation of field maps, (ii) the effect of image distortion correction on the coregistration between anatomical and functional images, and (iii) the interaction between distortion and head motion, assessing the feasibility of using field maps to reduce this effect. We propose that field maps with acceptable noise levels can be generated easily using a dual echo-time EPI sequence and demonstrate the importance of distortion correction for anatomical coregistration, even for small distortions. Using a dual echo-time series to generate a unique field map at each time point, we characterize the interaction between head motion and geometric distortion. However, we suggest that the variance between successively measured field maps introduces additional unwanted variance in the voxel time-series and is therefore not adequate to correct for time-varying distortions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11969330/,

PMC11748630,Sexual dimorphism in neuromuscular junction size on a muscle used in courtship by green anole lizards.,"Erin L O'Bryant, Juli Wade",2002,Journal of neurobiology,"The green anole lizard exhibits seasonal courtship behavior that is sexually dimorphic. This courtship consists of the extension of a bright red throat fan (dewlap) associated with head-bobbing display behavior. While males extend their dewlaps in aggressive encounters as well as in courtship, females use their considerably smaller dewlaps much less frequently and mainly in agonistic encounters. In parallel, a number of components of the neuromuscular system controlling dewlap extension are greater in males than in females during the breeding season, including dewlap motoneuron soma size and muscle fiber size and number. These features do not seem to change substantially in adulthood, despite a dramatic decline in dewlap use during the nonbreeding season. We explored the morphology of this neuromuscular system in more detail in the present experiment in males and females during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Fiber and whole muscle length (approximately perpendicular to the fibers) were measured. Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry was used to visualize neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and the surface area and density of NMJs were assessed for each animal. During the breeding season, NMJ size was larger in males than in females, but NMJ density along each fiber was equivalent between the sexes. In addition, whole muscle length and that of individual muscle fibers, was larger in males than in females. However, when corrected for body size, the sex difference in muscle fiber length disappeared. In the nonbreeding season, the sexual dimorphisms were maintained, suggesting that these features do not change substantially due to differences in circulating testosterone or a difference in use across seasons. Overall, these results are consistent with the idea that enhanced NMJ size is a relatively stable feature of the dewlap muscle in adulthood that either facilitates or is a consequence of using a larger muscle to extend a bigger dewlap in males compared to females.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11748630/,

Each of the six now recognized sterol disorders-mevalonic aciduria, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, desmosterolosis, Conradi-HÃ¼nermann syndrome, CHILD syndrome, and Greenberg dysplasia-has added to our knowledge of the relationship between cholesterol metabolism and embryogenesis. One of the most important lessons learned from the study of these disorders is that abnormal cholesterol metabolism impairs the function of the hedgehog class of embryonic signaling proteins, which help execute the vertebrate body plan during the earliest weeks of gestation. The study of the enzymes and genes in these several syndromes has also expanded and better delineated an important class of enzymes and proteins with diverse structural functions and metabolic actions that include sterol biosynthesis, nuclear transcriptional signaling, regulation of meiosis, and even behavioral modulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11701653/,

Quinpirole reduced DA and ACh release; PD 128,907 decreased DA but not ACh release. SCH 39166 stimulated DA and decreased ACh release. Pretreatment with quinpirole reduced or prevented (depending on the dose) the stimulation of DA release while potentiating the decrease of ACh release elicited by SCH 39166. Similarly, SCH 39166 administered following PD 128,907 did not stimulate DA release, further decreasing ACh release. These results indicate that quinpirole or PD 128,907 affect the actions of SCH 39166 on DA and ACh release in opposite manner, counteracting the increase of DA release and potentiating the reduction of ACh release. These data support the tenet that endogenous DA exerts a stimulatory input on striatal ACh neurotransmission mediated by D1 receptors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,

Our aim was to investigate the effect of H pylori eradication in this group of patients. We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in 70 patients with GORD. We assigned individuals to three groups. All patients received lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily for 10 days, followed by 30 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Patients infected with H pylori received either antibiotics (clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily) or placebo for the first 10 days. Controls were patients not infected with H pylori. Patients were followed up for 6 months at 2-week intervals for GORD symptoms. At the end of the study we repeated endoscopy and oesophageal and gastric 24 h-pH monitoring. 58 of 70 patients completed our study. At the end of the study 16 of these patients were H pylori-positive (14 placebo and two eradication failures), 13 were negative because of successful H pylori eradication, and 29 were controls. H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier (54 days) than did those in whom H pylori was eradicated (100 days) (p=0.046). The H pylori-negative control group relapsed after the longest period (110 days). However, time to relapse was also affected by oesophagitis grade (no oesophagitis 127 days, grade III or IV oesophagitis 18 days). When results were corrected for the affect of oesophagitis grade, H pylori-positive patients relapsed earlier (p=0.086) than H pylori-eradiated patients and controls (p=0.001). H pylori infection positively affects the relapse rate of GORD. Eradication of H pylori could, therefore, help to prolong disease-free interval in patients with GORD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11403809/,

In this technique, all the bypass anastomoses are supplied by the left internal mammary artery (IMA). Changes in flow conditions or flow redistribution in the subclavian artery may thus sigificantly influence coronary perfusion. The objective of this study was to determine whether changes in blood flow in the subclavian artery affect the flow in IMA grafts in patients who have undergone complete arterial revascularization with T-grafts. Quantitative flow volume and flow profiles in the IMA graft and the proximal subclavian artery were measured with a flow-wire in 20 patients one week postoperatively. Following baseline measurements, brachial artery constriction was achieved by applying a blood pressure measurement cuff to the patient's left upper arm. After 5 minutes, quantitative flow in the IMA and in the proximal subclavian artery was assessed. The cuff was then released and the measurements repeated. Flow in the subclavian artery changed significantly (p < 0.01) from baseline (355.4 +/- 95.2 ml/ min) to constriction (171.2 +/- 61.3 ml/min) and hyperemia (679.3 +/- 195.1 ml/min). Flow in the IMA graft remained constant irrespective of subclavian artery flow (75.4 +/- 26.2 ml/min vs. 78.0 +/- 28.9 ml/min vs. 75.5 +/- 29.3 ml/min, respectively). The flow profile in the IMA was similarily unchanged. In patients in whom the coronary bypass blood flow is dependent on the left IMA, neither the quantitative flow volume nor the flow profile are altered by changes in blood flow of the subclavian artery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11339457/,

PMC11353732,The effects of bilateral hippocampal damage on fMRI regional activations and interactions during memory retrieval.,"E A Maguire, F Vargha-Khadem, M Mishkin",2001,Brain : a journal of neurology,"Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we examined successful retrieval of real-world memories in a patient (Jon) with selective bilateral hippocampal pathology resulting from perinatal hypoxia compared with healthy control subjects. Jon activated the same brain regions during memory retrieval as control subjects, both medial and lateral on the left. In contrast to controls, Jon also activated many homologous regions on the right. In spite of having 50% volume loss bilaterally in his hippocampi, retrieval in Jon was associated with increased activation of the hippocampi. Furthermore, hippocampal activity, as with the controls, was differential, being most responsive to retrieval of autobiographical events compared with other memory types (autobiographical facts, public events, general knowledge). Jon made a distinction between events that the control subjects did not make, namely that some of the autobiographical and public events he clearly remembered, while others he found that he knew about but did not truly remember. His hippocampi and medial frontal cortex were significantly more active during retrieval of events for which he had clear and conscious recollection compared with those he knew as much about, including the context, but could not remember experiencing. Although Jon activates the same network of brain regions as the controls (albeit bilaterally), and with the same pattern of response in the hippocampus, the communication between regions differs from controls with regard to hippocampal-cortical connectivity. In controls there was increased effective connectivity between parahippocampal cortex and hippocampus, specifically during the retrieval of autobiographical events. In contrast, this increase was not apparent in Jon; rather, retrieval of autobiographical events elicited greater interaction between the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, and also increased interaction between retrosplenial and medial frontal cortex. This study underlines the value of scanning patients using fMRI while they undertake tasks they can perform, in this case allowing us to confirm the functionality of remaining tissue in the damaged hippocampi, and to appreciate the neural basis of a distinction (remember/know) that control subjects do not make. Besides refining our knowledge of the hippocampal role in autobiographical event memory, this study indicates that recruitment of bilateral regions during memory retrieval, and altered patterns of effective connectivity between brain regions may be important indicators of disordered memory.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,

Protein expression was investigated in normal, nonirradiated adult fibroblasts and also in fibroblastic cells from a benign cutaneous tumour after chronic ultraviolet (UVB) exposure and a metastatic cutaneous tumour after intermittent exposure. Proteins were separated and visualised by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and a peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) was obtained for protein spots using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS). Cross-species PMF database analysis facilitated the identification of 120 proteins, constituting 46.5% of the proteins analysed. The identification of two proteins was confirmed by internal amino acid sequencing using tandem MS. Differential protein expression was observed between normal fibroblasts and those in tumours chronically or intermittently exposed. A number of tropomyosin and vimentin isoforms were expressed only in cells from the metastatic tumour induced by intermittent exposure to UV radiation. These results highlight the value of cross-species PMF analysis for the rapid characterisation of proteins from a poorly defined species and also show how proteomics can be used to detect changes in protein expression in differentially treated cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,
